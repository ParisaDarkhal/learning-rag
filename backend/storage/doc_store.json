Introduction\\r\\nThe autonomic nervous system (ANS) plays a pivotal role in maintaining homeosta-\\r\\nsis by modulating various vital processes, including heart rate, blood pressure, respira-\\r\\ntory rate, gastrointestinal motility, and glandular secretions [1]. Understanding the \\r\\npharmacology of the ANS is paramount in medicine, particularly in anesthesia and other \\r\\nacute medical specialities, as it allows healthcare professionals to manipulate autonomic \\r\\npathways effectively and achieve desirable clinical outcomes [2]. This chapter aims to \\r\\nprovide a comprehensive overview of ANS pharmacology, focusing on the sympathetic \\r\\n(SANS) and parasympathetic (PANS) divisions and their associated receptors. Understanding the receptor selectivity of pharmacological agents is paramount in \\r\\nachieving desired clinical outcomes. Many drugs exhibit selectivity for specific adrener-\\r\\ngic or cholinergic receptors, allowing for targeted modulation of the SANS and PANS [3]. Healthcare professionals can manipulate autonomic pathways to optimize patient care by \\r\\ncarefully selecting and administering peripheral nervous system agonists or antagonists. The knowledge of ANS pharmacology is particularly crucial in acute medical spe-\\r\\ncialities, where precise control over the cardiovascular system, airway dynamics, and\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"7bb91553-a7ca-4048-89ec-bf013f35f7c5":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"7bb91553-a7ca-4048-89ec-bf013f35f7c5\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"EQVoT1wXp6GZIzI9Q/sDR9ANcgF9Pl9nDbzmpmcgnS8=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"bsuG96e6eJm+zg0TdlfUcD58kumiPMBZ+zgxwQd4frc=\"}},\"hash\":\"4duwms3vQP+wjo4sPvPL7abPONEIvov/K+I5C36qpAQ=\",\"text\":\"Topics in Autonomic Nervous System\\r\\n2\\r\\nother physiological parameters is essential.

This knowledge enhances patient safety and improves clinical outcomes across vari-\\r\\nous medical disciplines. 2. Pharmacology of the sympathetic nervous system\\r\\nThe SANS, often referred to as the “fight or flight” system, prepares the body \\r\\nfor physical exertion and stressful situations. The primary neurotransmitter in the \\r\\nSANS is norepinephrine (noradrenaline), which interacts with adrenergic receptors \\r\\nlocated throughout the body. These receptors are categorized into two main subtypes: α and β [1]. The α-adrenergic receptors are further divided into α-1 and α-2 subtypes. α-1 \\r\\nreceptors are predominantly located in blood vessels, leading to vasoconstriction \\r\\nwhen activated. This effect increases systemic vascular resistance, elevating blood \\r\\npressure. α-1 agonists such as phenylephrine find clinical utility in managing hypoten-\\r\\nsion during anesthesia. Conversely, α-1 antagonists like prazosin induce vasodilation \\r\\nand alleviate conditions such as benign prostatic hyperplasia and hypertension. α-2 \\r\\nreceptors are primarily located presynaptically in sympathetic nerve terminals, where \\r\\ntheir activation inhibits the release of norepinephrine, resulting in negative feedback \\r\\nregulation of sympathetic outflow. Clonidine, an α-2 agonist, is commonly used in \\r\\nanesthesia and surgery to attenuate sympathetic responses, promote sedation, and \\r\\nenhance perioperative analgesia [1]. β-adrenergic receptors consist of three subtypes: β-1, β-2, and β-3. β-1 receptors \\r\\nare predominantly found in the heart, activating heart rate and contractility [1]. β-1 \\r\\nagonists like dobutamine enhance cardiac output in patients with heart failure or \\r\\ncardiogenic shock. β-1 antagonists, such as metoprolol, are widely used in to mitigate \\r\\nthe adverse effects of excessive sympathetic stimulation on the cardiovascular system \\r\\n[3]. β-2 receptors are abundant in the bronchial smooth muscle and peripheral vascu-\\r\\nlature, leading to bronchodilation and vasodilation when stimulated [1]. β-2 agonists \\r\\nlike salbutamol are commonly utilized to manage asthma and chronic obstructive \\r\\npulmonary disease (COPD) [3]. Conversely, β-2 antagonists may be used in conditions like glaucoma, where \\r\\nreduced intraocular pressure is desirable [3]. β-3 receptors are primarily present in \\r\\nadipose tissue, where their activation promotes lipolysis. While the therapeutic sig-\\r\\nnificance of β-3 receptors is still being explored, their modulation may hold potential \\r\\nin treating obesity and metabolic disorders. 2.1 Sympathomimetics2.1.1 α-1 receptor agonists\\r\\nα-1 receptors dominate most of the smooth muscle of the autonomic target \\r\\norgans.

Drugs that mimic the action of epinephrine and norepinephrine can \\r\\nbe called sympathomimetics. These drugs can be divided into direct and indirect \\r\\nagonists [4]. Direct agonists interact with the adrenoreceptor directly and subsequently \\r\\nactivate them, while indirect agonists depend on their ability to enhance the effect \\r\\nof endogenous catecholamines. The indirect agonist can do so by (i) displacing \\r\\ncatecholamine from their adrenergic nerve endings and inducing their release (e.g., \\r\\nthe mechanism of action of tyramine), (ii) inhibiting the clearance of catechol-\\r\\namines by decreasing their neuronal reuptake (e.g., the mechanism of action of \\r\\ncocaine and tricyclic antidepressants), or (iii) preventing the enzymatic metabo-\\r\\nlism of norepinephrine (monoamine oxidase and catechol-O-methyltransferase \\r\\ninhibitors) [4]. 2.1.1.1 Direct-acting α-agonists\\r\\n2.1.1.1.1 Phenylephrine\\r\\nThe chemical formula of phenylephrine is C9H13NO2. It is an α-1 adrenergic agonist \\r\\nthat only affects β receptors at very high doses. As it is not a catechol derivative, it is \\r\\nnot broken down by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and has a longer duration \\r\\nof action than catecholamines. It can cause an increase in blood pressure by venous \\r\\nand arteriolar vasoconstriction, and since it does not act on β receptors, there is no \\r\\ndirect effect on cardiac muscle. The increase in blood pressure causes reflex bradycar-\\r\\ndia by stimulation of baroreceptors [5]. The intravenous (IV) phenylephrine hydrochloride increases blood pressure in \\r\\nadults with clinically significant hypotension resulting primarily from vasodilation \\r\\nin such settings as septic shock or anesthesia. Phenylephrine hydrochloride (HCL) \\r\\nis also used over-the-counter in ophthalmic formulations to promote mydriasis and \\r\\nconjunctival blood vessel vasoconstriction, intranasal administration as a treatment \\r\\nfor uncomplicated nasal congestion, and as an over-the-counter additive to topical \\r\\nhemorrhoid medications [5]. The ophthalmic formulations of phenylephrine act for 3–8 hours, while intrave-\\r\\nnous solutions have a practical half-life of 5 minutes and an elimination half-life of \\r\\n2.5 hours. The bioavailability orally is 38%, and ophthalmic solutions have clinically \\r\\nsignificant absorption, especially if the cornea is damaged. This drug is mainly \\r\\nmetabolized by monoamine oxidase A, monoamine oxidase B, and sulfotransferase \\r\\nfamily 1A member 3 (SULT1A3). The primary metabolite it forms is the inactive \\r\\nmeta-hydroxymandelic acid, followed by sulfate conjugates. It can also be metabo-\\r\\nlized to phenylephrine glucuronide. About 86% of the drug is recovered in urine; 16% \\r\\nof it is unmetabolized, and 57% of it is inactive meta-hydroxymendelic acid, and 8% \\r\\nis inactive sulfate conjugates [6]. The adverse effects of these drugs are nausea, vomiting, and confusion. Since \\r\\nphenylepinephrine increases the afterload more than the preload, the decreased \\r\\ncardiac output can also lead to severe bradycardia, exacerbating angina, heart failure, \\r\\nand pulmonary hypertension. Overdose can be treated by discontinuing the medica-\\r\\ntion, chronotropic medications, and vasodilators [5]. There are no absolute contraindications for using this drug apart from hypersen-\\r\\nsitivity reactions such as anaphylaxis or less severe asthmatic episodes. Currently, no \\r\\nantidote is available to reverse this drug’s effects. The treatment of hypertension and \\r\\nreflex bradycardia is discontinuing the administration of the drug [5].\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"30b325f8-0d17-4f4d-93a1-7c2686963f1f":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"30b325f8-0d17-4f4d-93a1-7c2686963f1f\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"q5iXy3I+uxnykZWdy938tLCu8HceZABIA6Lokext7Z4=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"SW0rtXZZNHYjgwm2KQcZaJe/KC98JlxTkRPNfVqK2xo=\"}},\"hash\":\"wymp/+KB9+HRPlgwGpR8N2zaWKUwPFzA6c3rFDdZXuA=\",\"text\":\"Topics in Autonomic Nervous System\\r\\n4\\r\\n2.1.1.1.2 Midodrine\\r\\nMidodrine is a prodrug (medication that turns into active form once it enters the \\r\\nbody). It is used to manage patients with orthostatic hypotension or hypotension \\r\\nsecondary to other clinical conditions or drug therapies [7]. The chemical formula of this drug is C12H19ClN2O4. It is water-soluble and dis-\\r\\ntributed as tablets for oral administration. Dosage forms are 2.5 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg. Midodrine is almost completely absorbed after oral administration and undergoes \\r\\nenzymatic hydrolysis to form its pharmacologically active metabolite, de-glymido-\\r\\ndrine. The drug should be stored in an airtight container [8]. The plasma levels of this prodrug peak at about half an hour and decline with \\r\\na half-life of approximately 25 minutes. The peak concentration of the metabo-\\r\\nlites reaches about 1–2 hours, and their half-life is about 3–4 hours. The absolute \\r\\nbioavailability is 93% and is not affected by food. Midodrine deglycination to \\r\\ndesglymidodrine appears in many tissues, and the liver metabolizes both com-\\r\\npounds [9]. It does not act on cardiac β-adrenergic receptors and poorly diffuses across the \\r\\nblood-brain barrier. Increased embryo reabsorption is revealed in animal studies, as \\r\\nwell as reduced fetal body weight and decreased fetal survival. There is no controlled \\r\\ndata on human pregnancy. It is labeled US FDA Pregnancy category C, but the poten-\\r\\ntial benefits may warrant the use in pregnant women, despite potential risks. No data \\r\\nis available for excretion in animal and human milk, but use should be avoided, and \\r\\ncaution is recommended [8]. The contraindications to the drug are allergy to the drug, kidney disease, or, if one \\r\\ncannot urinate, pheochromocytoma (adrenal gland tumor), overactive thyroid, high \\r\\nblood pressure even while lying down, and liver disease. Taking this drug alongside \\r\\nother drugs that constrict the blood vessels can increase blood pressure. Common \\r\\nadverse effects (1–10%) of the drug are supine hypertension, paresthesia, headache, \\r\\nnpiloerection, dysuria, nausea, dyspepsia, and vomiting [8]. The oral lethal dose (LD 50) is approximately 30–50 mg/kg in rats, 67.5 mg/kg in \\r\\nmice, and 125–160 mg/kg in dogs. Overdose symptoms could include hypertension, \\r\\npiloerection (goosebumps), a sensation of coldness, and urinary retention. The single \\r\\ndoses associated with overdosage or potentially life-threatening symptoms in humans \\r\\nare unknown. Desglymidodrine is dialyzable [9]. 2.1.1.2 Indirect-acting α-agonists\\r\\n2.1.1.2.1 Ephedrine\\r\\nEphedrine is an α- and β-adrenergic agonist; however, it also causes the indirect \\r\\nrelease of norepinephrine from sympathetic neurons, inhibiting norepinephrine \\r\\nreuptake and displacing more norepinephrine from storage vesicles. Its use is indi-\\r\\ncated in treating hypotension under anesthesia, allergic conditions, bronchial asthma, \\r\\nand nasal congestion. Its chemical formula is C10H15NO [10]. Ephedrine can be administered through oral, nasal, and intravenous routes (tab-\\r\\nlet/capsule:8–25 mg, Solution—0.5%, IV: 10–15 mg/1 mL). Ephedrine increases blood \\r\\npressure by stimulating heart rate and cardiac output and variably increasing periph-\\r\\neral resistance. Activation of β-adrenergic receptors in the lungs causes bronchodila-\\r\\ntion. By stimulating α-adrenergic receptors in bladder smooth muscle cells, ephedrine \\r\\nalso increases the resistance to the outflow of urine.

The bioavailability of ephedrine is 88%, and oral ephedrine reaches an average \\r\\nmaximum concentration (Cmax) of 79.5 ng/mL, with a time-to-peak concentration \\r\\n(Tmax) of 1.81 hours [10]. Ephedrine is largely unmetabolized in the body and can be N-demethylated to nor-\\r\\nephedrine or demethylated and deaminized to benzoic acid conjugates and 1,2-hydroxy-\\r\\npropyl benzene. The route of elimination is through the urine; about 60% is excreted as \\r\\nunmetabolized parent compound and 13% as benzoic acid conjugates and 1% as 1,2-dihy-\\r\\ndroxypropylbenzene. There is a large degree of inter-patient variability on the half-life of \\r\\nthis drug, but orally, the plasma elimination half-life is approximately 6 hours [10]. Its use is contraindicated in people with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, \\r\\nhyperthyroidism, pheochromocytoma, and closed-angle glaucoma [11]. Large doses \\r\\nof ephedrine cause nervousness, insomnia, vertigo, headache, tachycardia, palpita-\\r\\ntion, and sweating. Some patients have nausea, vomiting, and anorexia. Painful \\r\\nurination may occur as a result of a vesical sphincter spasm. Urinary retention may \\r\\ndevelop in males with prostatism. Cardiac arrhythmias and precordial pain may occur \\r\\nfollowing administration of ephedrine sulfate injection, USP [11]. The LD50 in mice after oral administration is 785 mg/kg, after intraperitoneal \\r\\nadministration is 248 mg/kg, and after subcutaneous administration is 425 mg/kg. An overdose of ephedrine will present with rapidly increasing blood pressure. The \\r\\noverdose can be managed with blood pressure monitoring and possibly administering \\r\\nparenteral antihypertensives [10]. 2.1.1.2.2 Methamphetamine\\r\\nIt is a sympathomimetic agent widely used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity  \\r\\ndisorder (ADHD) and exogenous obesity. Its chemical formula is C10H15N. Methamphetamine is a white solid odorless crystal. The recommended storage tem-\\r\\nperature is −20°C. This drug is a potent stimulant of the central nervous system, and \\r\\nit affects the neurochemical mechanisms responsible for regulating body tempera-\\r\\nture, heart rate, blood pressure, appetite, attention, mood, and responses associated \\r\\nwith alertness or alarm conditions. The drug’s acute effects closely resemble the \\r\\npsychological and physiological effects of an epinephrine-provoked flight-or-fight \\r\\nresponse; these responses include increased heart rate, vasoconstriction, increased \\r\\nblood pressure, hyperglycemia, and bronchodilation. It causes the elimination of \\r\\nfatigue, increased mental alertness, increased focus, and decreased appetite [12]. When methamphetamine enters the brain, it causes a cascade of norepinephrine, \\r\\ndopamine, and serotonin release. It acts as a dopaminergic and adrenergic reuptake \\r\\ninhibitor to a lesser extent, and in a higher concentration, it can act as a monoamine \\r\\noxidase inhibitor [12]. Absorption of methamphetamine occurs in the gastrointestinal tract, with peak \\r\\nconcentrations occurring at 3.13–6.3 hours after ingestion, and its effects may con-\\r\\ntinue up to 24 hours in larger doses. When the drug is administered by inhalation, or \\r\\nintranasally, a high degree of absorption occurs. The drug has a high lipophilicity; \\r\\nit is distributed across the blood-brain barrier and crosses the placenta. This drug \\r\\nshould be avoided in breastfeeding mothers as it is excreted through milk. The drug \\r\\nexcretion occurs through the urine and increases with the acidic pH metabolization of \\r\\nmethamphetamine occurs in the liver by aromatic hydroxylation, N-dealkylation, and \\r\\ndeamination; at least seven metabolites have been identified in urine [12, 13].\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"111ee5b2-d986-4ac1-95fc-0500dd6694e3":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"111ee5b2-d986-4ac1-95fc-0500dd6694e3\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"r40sXPz/kSDgxlqjNa6yS8ZXOXQXg5jlAY+uDHiXXzE=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"ZOmeh3qfwfQXtQhS9+LiuHE4cxC6j1YfXemO+0iXr6U=\"}},\"hash\":\"aP4XiP2ERpU/hEVZNJP9t/7NDeKb/5s/VN2wa//jZfQ=\",\"text\":\"Topics in Autonomic Nervous System\\r\\n6\\r\\nThe concurrent use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors with methamphetamine \\r\\nis contraindicated as a hypertensive crisis may occur.

It is a Pregnancy category C drug. It is \\r\\nshown to have teratogenic and embryocidal effects in mammals given multiple high \\r\\nhuman doses. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women, \\r\\nbut it is recommended not to be used during pregnancy unless the potential benefit \\r\\njustifies the potential risk to the fetus [14]. Acute overdose of methamphetamine is manifested by restlessness, tremor, hyper-\\r\\nreflexia, rapid respiration, confusion, assaultiveness, hallucinations, panic states, \\r\\nhyperpyrexia, and rhabdomyolysis. Fatigue and depression usually follow the central \\r\\nstimulation. Cardiovascular effects include arrhythmias, hypertension or hypotension, \\r\\nand circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, \\r\\nand abdominal cramps. Fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma [12]. Therapeutic methamphetamine blood concentration is 20–60 ug/dL; toxic meth-\\r\\namphetamine blood concentration is 60–500 ug/dL, and lethal methamphetamine \\r\\nblood concentration is 1–4 mg/dL [12]. Benzodiazepines represent first-line treat-\\r\\nment for methamphetamine toxicity but frequently require repeated and escalated \\r\\ndosing to achieve the effect [15].2.1.2 α-2 receptor agonists\\r\\nThe α-2 receptors constitute a family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) with \\r\\nthree pharmacological subtypes, α-2A, α-2B, and α-2C [16]. Most α-2A and α-2C sub-\\r\\ntypes are located mainly in the presynaptic central nervous system. When stimulated, \\r\\nthese receptor subtypes may be responsible for sedative, analgesic, and sympatholytic \\r\\neffects. On vascular smooth muscle, α-2B receptors are more prevalent and have been \\r\\nshown to mediate vasopressor effects. All three subtypes have been shown to inhibit \\r\\nadenylyl cyclase, resulting in decreased levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate and \\r\\nhyperpolarization of noradrenergic neurons in the medial dorsal pons, specifically in the \\r\\nlocus ceruleus [16]. As cyclic adenosine monophosphate is inhibited, potassium efflux \\r\\nvia calcium-activated channels prevents calcium ions from entering the nerve terminal, \\r\\ninhibiting neural discharge. This process inhibits the release of norepinephrine and \\r\\nreduces the activity of ascending noradrenergic pathways, resulting in hypnosis and \\r\\nsedation. Activation of this negative feedback loop may also result in decreased heart rate \\r\\nand blood pressure, as well as a diminished sympathetic stress response. Stimulation of α-2 receptors in the spinal column’s dorsal horn inhibits nociceptive neurons and reduces \\r\\nsubstance P release. Although there is evidence for supraspinal and peripheral sites of \\r\\naction, it is believed that the spinal mechanism accounts for the majority of the analgesic \\r\\neffects of α-2 agonist drugs [16]. Guanabenz, guanfacine, clonidine, tizanidine, medetomidine, and dexmedeto-\\r\\nmidine are all α-2 agonists with different potencies and affinities for different α-2 \\r\\nreceptor subtypes. Clonidine, tizanidine, and dexmedetomidine have seen the most \\r\\nclinical use and will be discussed in greater depth. 2.1.2.1 Clonidine\\r\\nClonidine, an imidazole molecule, is a selective partial agonist for α-2 adrenoceptors \\r\\nwith a 200:1 ratio (α2–α1).\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"1882b900-52c8-4f99-9229-fee69f659973":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"1882b900-52c8-4f99-9229-fee69f659973\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"KtCzBZC0ymyVsV5RyBq/aR3zQ6kFxy/jScXf4hhRzhU=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"nf4TkjfSIluFZ0Yimx1raR6djZYMRe8GPqcmCNPUPPA=\"}},\"hash\":\"/xGyiuH7Q7JBZLdnJTNoSi41LZed4yXlBLXlG35Gc4Q=\",\"text\":\"7\\r\\nPharmacology of the Autonomic Nervous System\\r\\nDOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.113006\\r\\nClonidine stimulates the brain stem’s α-adrenoreceptors. This action diminishes \\r\\ncentral nervous system sympathetic outflow and decreases peripheral resistance, \\r\\nrenal vascular resistance, heart rate, and blood pressure. Clonidine can be administered via various routes: oral, intravenous, transdermal, \\r\\nrectal, and different neuraxial routes. It is rapidly and nearly completely absorbed fol-\\r\\nlowing the oral route, reaching peak plasma levels in 60–90 minutes. A time-release \\r\\ntransdermal patch can also administer clonidine; however, therapeutic levels require \\r\\nat least 2 days. It has an elimination half-life of 8–12 hours, with 50% of the drug \\r\\nmetabolized in the liver to inactive metabolites and the rest being excreted unaltered \\r\\nin the kidney [17]. 2.1.2.2 Clinical uses\\r\\nClonidine and guanfacine may be used to treat children and adolescents with \\r\\nattention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The reduced firing of presynaptic neurons \\r\\nreleasing norepinephrine into the prefrontal cortex decreases the impulsive and \\r\\nhyperactive behavior seen in ADHD. Because of their additive effects on serotonin \\r\\nand γ-aminobutyric acid receptors, α-2 agonists are the most commonly utilized \\r\\ndrugs to treat lack of sleep in children with ADHD. Clonidine also treats chronic pain \\r\\ndisorders and withdrawal from opiates, benzodiazepines, alcohol, cocaine, food, and \\r\\ncigarette smoke [17]. Clonidine as an adjuvant has several advantages, including a reduction in the \\r\\namount of opioids necessary for analgesia and hence a likely reduction in opioid-\\r\\nrelated side effects, titrated sedation and anxiolysis with no additive respiratory \\r\\ndepression when combined with opioids and vasodilation and enhanced circulation \\r\\nof the cerebral, coronary, and visceral vascular beds [17]. Clonidine has lately been utilized as a premedication in individuals with consider-\\r\\nable pretreatment anxiety. It has been found to improve mask application during \\r\\nanesthesia induction and to reduce anesthetic requirements by 40–60% in the \\r\\npediatric population. 2.1.2.3 Dexmedetomidine\\r\\nDexmedetomidine, as clonidine, is a highly selective α-2 agonist with a higher \\r\\naffinity for the α-2 receptor (Figure 1). Clonidine has a specificity of 220: 1 (α-2: α-1), \\r\\nwhile dexmedetomidine has a specificity of 1620: 1. It is a full agonist of α-2 adrener-\\r\\ngic receptors and the pharmacologically active d-isomer of medetomidine [18]. Dexmedetomidine induces a state of unconsciousness equivalent to normal sleep \\r\\nby activating central pre- and postsynaptic α-2 receptors in the locus ceruleus, with \\r\\nthe added benefit of patients remaining easily stimulated and cooperative. Dexmedetomidine generates a dose-dependent biphasic blood pressure response. Low-dose intravenous infusion lowers mean arterial pressure due to selectivity for \\r\\ncentral and peripheral α-2 receptors. The subsequent decreases in heart rate and \\r\\nsystemic vascular resistance indirectly diminish cardiac output and systolic blood \\r\\npressure. These actions help modulate the stress response, improve stability, and \\r\\nguard against drastic changes in cardiovascular parameters after surgery [18]. Dexmedetomidine can be given orally, intravenously, intramuscularly, buccally, and \\r\\nintranasally. It has a two-compartment distribution and elimination model. It has a (T1/2 \\r\\nβ) of 2 hours for elimination. However, it is a highly lipophilic medication that rapidly \\r\\ndispersed and redistributed, with a (T1/2 α) of only 6 minutes for distribution.

Dexmedetomidine’s context-sensitive \\r\\nhalf-life ranges from 4 minutes after a 10-minute infusion to 250 minutes after an \\r\\n8-hour infusion [18]. 2.1.2.4 Clinical uses\\r\\nDexmedetomidine has three primary therapeutic applications: (a) in-hospital \\r\\nprolonged sedation, (b) procedure sedation and general anesthesia, and (c) obtund-\\r\\ning emerging delirium. It is utilized as a sedative drug in critical care settings for \\r\\ncritically ill patients who require prolonged sedation and mechanical ventilation. Dexmedetomidine possesses all of the features of an ideal critical care sedative. It \\r\\ndoes not cause respiratory depression, is analgesic and anxiolytic, has a fast onset, \\r\\nis titratable, and promotes drowsiness while maintaining hemodynamic stabil-\\r\\nity. Finally, dexmedetomidine is exceptionally effective in treating the emerging \\r\\ndelirium that can occur after general anesthesia, particularly in children. It has a \\r\\nsignificant relaxing effect without causing respiratory depression. This is a signifi-\\r\\ncant benefit over other medications typically used in such situations and requires \\r\\nadditional study.2.1.3 β-1 agonists\\r\\n2.1.3.1 Dobutamine\\r\\nDobutamine is a synthetic sympathomimetic drug that selectively stimulates \\r\\nβ-1 adrenergic receptors.

Dobutamine is typically \\r\\navailable as a solution for intravenous infusion. The healthcare provider determines \\r\\nthe concentration and dosage regimen based on the individual’s specific needs. Pharmacokinetically, dobutamine is administered intravenously due to its poor \\r\\noral bioavailability. It has a rapid onset of action and a short duration of action.

In \\r\\nthe clinical settings, dobutamine primarily treats acute heart failure or cardiogenic \\r\\nshock. It is used to improve cardiac contractility and increase cardiac output in these \\r\\nconditions. 2.1.3.2 Dopamine\\r\\nDopamine is a neurotransmitter and a sympathomimetic drug that acts on dopamine \\r\\nreceptors in the central and peripheral nervous systems. It is crucial in physiological \\r\\nprocesses, including movement, motivation, reward, and blood pressure regulation. Dopamine is typically available as a solution for intravenous infusion. The healthcare \\r\\nprovider determines the concentration and dosage regimen based on the individual’s \\r\\nspecific needs. Pharmacokinetically, dopamine is administered intravenously due to its poor oral \\r\\nbioavailability. It has a rapid onset of action and a short duration of action. The drug \\r\\nis rapidly metabolized in the liver and excreted in the urine. Dopamine acts on different receptors, including dopamine receptors, α-1 adren-\\r\\nergic receptors, and β-adrenergic receptors. Its effects vary depending on the dose \\r\\nadministered. Dopamine primarily stimulates dopamine receptors at low doses, \\r\\nleading to renal and mesenteric vasodilation. It activates higher doses of α-1 and β-1 \\r\\nadrenergic receptors, increasing cardiac contractility and vasoconstriction. Dopamine treats various conditions, including hypotension, shock, and low \\r\\ncardiac output states. It helps increase blood pressure and cardiac output by improv-\\r\\ning cardiac contractility and causing peripheral vasoconstriction. 2.1.3.3 Epinephrine (adrenaline)\\r\\nEpinephrine, also known as adrenaline, is a naturally occurring catecholamine \\r\\nand a potent nonselective adrenergic agonist. It acts on α- and β-adrenergic receptors, \\r\\nproducing various physiological effects. Epinephrine is available in different formula-\\r\\ntions, including solutions for intravenous injection, autoinjectors, and inhalers. The \\r\\nconcentration and specific formulation may vary depending on the intended use. Epinephrine can be administered via various routes, including intravenous, \\r\\nintramuscular, subcutaneous, and inhalation. It has a rapid onset of action and a short \\r\\nduration of action. The drug is metabolized in the liver and other tissues, and the \\r\\nmetabolites are excreted in the urine. Epinephrine acts on both α- and β-adrenergic \\r\\nreceptors. It produces various effects, including increased heart rate and contractility, \\r\\nbronchodilation, peripheral vasoconstriction, and increased blood pressure. These \\r\\neffects are beneficial in emergencies such as anaphylaxis, cardiac arrest, and severe \\r\\nasthma exacerbations. Epinephrine is used in various emergencies, including anaphylaxis (severe allergic \\r\\nreactions), cardiac arrest, bronchospasm, and severe asthma exacerbations. It also \\r\\nrestores blood pressure and maintains organ perfusion during resuscitation efforts.2.1.4 β-2 agonists\\r\\nβ-adrenergic receptor agonists have long been used to treat both acute asthma \\r\\nsymptoms and the prevention of exercise-induced asthma in adults and children\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"3a8ccec9-3386-438f-a6a4-a086008024d0":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"3a8ccec9-3386-438f-a6a4-a086008024d0\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"VzWWUj9y1tJx7Cabigm0A/GI/xkY4a4Bn5LfBI+jVLw=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"80i8ej4eur8TPH9bmAtguzWXRsw4kbNihZfCsleoocM=\"}},\"hash\":\"pwhKbL97R2GRm+mAOgV0Y4qwvLYiCmKFZ89L5itxxqs=\",\"text\":\"Topics in Autonomic Nervous System\\r\\n10\\r\\nand to treat COPD. They mimic the actions of catecholamines such as epinephrine, \\r\\nnorepinephrine, and dopamine in triggering various autonomic responses within the \\r\\nbody. β-2 agonists significantly affect the smooth muscle of the airway, uterus, gut, \\r\\nand systemic vasculature. As part of our functional autonomic system, circulating catecholamines \\r\\nstimulate adrenergic receptors, resulting in parasympathetic and sympathetic \\r\\nphysiological reactions. β-2 agonists operate as ligands to adrenergic receptors \\r\\nwith higher selectivity for β-2 adrenergic receptors, mimicking catecholamines. When the β-2 adrenergic receptor is activated, a transmembrane signal cascade is \\r\\ninitiated that includes the heterotrimeric G protein, Gs, and the effector, adenylyl \\r\\ncyclase. Adenylyl cyclase then raises intracellular cAMP through ATP hydrolysis. The increased cAMP concentration activates the cAMP-dependent protein kinase \\r\\nA (PKA). PKA can phosphorylate intracellular substrates, which modulate vari-\\r\\nous actions within the cell. PKA, in particular, operates in airway smooth muscle \\r\\nto phosphorylate Gq-coupled receptors, resulting in a cascade of intracellular \\r\\nsignals that have been postulated to diminish intracellular Ca2+ or decrease Ca2+ \\r\\nsensitivity [19]. The increase in Ca2+ inhibits myosin light chain phosphorylation, which prevents \\r\\nairway smooth muscle contraction. This is the underlying mechanism of β-2 ago-\\r\\nnists, which boost bronchodilatory effects and are used to treat a variety of common \\r\\nrespiratory disorders. There have been suggestions that β-2 agonists have anti-\\r\\ninflammatory effects within the airway smooth muscle by decreasing intercellular \\r\\nadhesion molecule-1, decreasing granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor \\r\\nrelease, and stabilizing mast cell degranulation by inhibiting multiple inflamma-\\r\\ntory pathways.T16 The duration and start of the action of β-2 agonists influence their \\r\\nclassification. The three categories are short-acting, long-acting, and, most recently, \\r\\nultra-long-acting β-agonists. 2.1.4.1 Short-acting β-2 agonists\\r\\nThey are first-line drugs for treating acute asthma symptoms and exacerbations. They are also often used in treating COPD in conjunction with long-acting, inhaled \\r\\ncorticosteroids or long-acting muscarinic agonists. These drugs are often adminis-\\r\\ntered through inhalation, either metered dosage, dry powder inhalation, or nebu-\\r\\nlization. Compared to alternative oral delivery, inhalation has a higher therapeutic \\r\\nbenefit and fewer systemic side effects. This family includes Salbutamol (albuterol), \\r\\nTerbutaline, Levalbuterol, and Pirbuterol. 2.1.4.2 Salbutamol\\r\\nSalbutamol absorption is highly dependent on both formulation and dosage as \\r\\nwell as the way of delivery. A thorough description of the effect of delivery systems \\r\\non salbutamol pharmacokinetics may occupy many book chapters and is beyond the \\r\\nscope of this piece; however, we will consider some of the key points. Salbutamol is \\r\\nusually administered via a compressed metered-dose inhaler with an immense buffer. This very efficient delivery mechanism assures good distribution, especially to small- \\r\\nto moderate-sized airways. It can, however, be inhaled using a dry powder inhaler, or \\r\\nnebulizer, orally or intravenously. Salbutamol, a partial agonist, has the greatest bronchodilating action at low \\r\\ndosages.

This binding causes a postsynaptic action on adenyl cyclase, \\r\\nresulting in the formation of intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) from ATP, which in \\r\\nturn stimulates other effector molecules, including cAMP-dependent protein kinase \\r\\nA (PKA) and nucleotide exchange factor, which work together to cause intracellular \\r\\nCa2+ sequestration, resulting in ASM relaxation. Despite that salbutamol’s primary \\r\\nfunction is bronchodilation, it also suppresses mast cell mediator release and tumor \\r\\nnecrosis factor α (TNF) release from monocytes. It also enhances mucus production \\r\\nand clearance of the mucociliary tract. It has extensive effects across numerous organ \\r\\nsystems as a sympathomimetic, and it causes dose-dependent tachycardia, hypergly-\\r\\ncemia, hypokalemia, and tremor. The systemic metabolic effects inducing glycogen \\r\\nbreakdown and concomitant insulin release (possibly stimulated by pancreatic β2 \\r\\ncells) combine to cause high blood sugar levels and serum hypokalemia, with the \\r\\nformer occurring as a consequence of cellular sodium excretion and potassium influx \\r\\n(Na-K-ATPase pump). This side effect is beneficial in the emergency treatment of hyperkalemia, where \\r\\nongoing salbutamol administration can decrease serum potassium between 1 and \\r\\n1.5 mmol/L. However, it can also have complications such as dose-related tremors \\r\\n(the salbutamol shakes’), and when combined with cardiac receptor stimulation, \\r\\nstimulation can lead to tachyarrhythmias. Tachyphylaxis to β-2 agonists arises as soon \\r\\nas 1 week after starting regular medication and is more apparent with β 2-agonist \\r\\nmonotherapy. 2.1.4.3 Terbutaline\\r\\nIt is also a selective β-2 adrenoceptor agonist used to prevent and reverse \\r\\n bronchoconstriction. Approximately, its volume of distribution is about 1.6 L/kg. After \\r\\n72 hours, an oral dose of terbutaline gets eliminated in the urine by 40%. Terbutaline \\r\\nsulfate conjugated was the most predominant metabolite in the urine. Terbutaline par-\\r\\nenteral levels are 90% removed in the urine, with roughly 2/3 as the unaltered primary \\r\\nsubstance. In the feces, less than 1% of a terbutaline dose gets eliminated. 2.1.4.4 Long-acting β-2 agonist\\r\\nThey are commonly used in managing asthma and COPD patients, often \\r\\n combined with inhaled corticosteroids. There is evidence that combination therapy \\r\\nis more effective than monotherapy. They have a longer onset time than short-acting \\r\\nmedications, with salmeterol having an onset period of up to 15 minutes and lasting \\r\\nat least 12 hours.

These drugs can be divided into two subtypes, selective \\r\\nand nonselective α-receptor blockers. Nonselective α-receptor antagonists block both the α-1 receptors as well as α-2 \\r\\nreceptors. Blocking α-1 receptor causes vasodilation, while α-2 receptor blockade will \\r\\nreduce the force of vasodilation due to increased release of Norepinephrine. These \\r\\nmedications, such as pheochromocytoma, are widely used in patients with increased \\r\\nsympathetic activity. Selective α-1 receptor blockers act on the receptors and cause vasodilation; therefore, \\r\\nthey are widely used in patients with hypertension and cause smooth muscle relax-\\r\\nation, so they help manage benign prostate hyperplasia [20]. The mechanism of action of α-2 receptor blockers is not known, although, in \\r\\nprinciple, they are known to inhibit negative feedback of norepinephrine release by \\r\\nstimulating the norepinephrine system, and they inhibit the effects of norepinephrine \\r\\non postsynaptic α-2 adrenoceptors [20, 21]. 2.2.1.1 Nonselective α-receptor blockers\\r\\n2.2.1.1.1 Phentolamine\\r\\nIt is a nonselective α-receptor blocker used mainly to diagnose pheochromocytoma \\r\\nand to control or prevent paroxysmal hypertension immediately before or during \\r\\npheochromocytoma ectomy.

Specific cases of emergent use for blood pressure control during pregnancy \\r\\nshowed no effects on the fetus or neonate. As the drug is excreted in small amounts in \\r\\nbreast milk, it should be used cautiously in breastfeeding mothers. Avoid alcohol and licorice with the use of this drug. Its absorption is not affected \\r\\nby food. Acute symptomatic liver injury due to prazosin is rare, and severe hepatotox-\\r\\nicity must be rare if it occurs at all [26]. 2.2.1.2.2 Tamsulosin\\r\\nIt is an α-1A and α-1B adrenergic receptor antagonist used to treat benign prostatic \\r\\nhyperplasia, ureteral stones, female voiding problems, and prostatitis. The chemical \\r\\nformula is C20H28N2O5S(R38). It is available in the form of tablets, and the dose for \\r\\ntreatment of adult benign prostate hyperplasia is 0.4 mg orally once a day; the dose \\r\\nmay be increased to 0.8 mg orally once a day in patients who fail to respond to 0.4 mg \\r\\nonce a day within 2–4 weeks [27]. The most significant effect of this drug is in the bladder and prostate, where \\r\\nthe α-1A and α-1B adrenergic receptors are most common. The drug’s action leads \\r\\nto the relaxation of prostate and bladder muscles, allowing for better urinary flow. Tamsulosin binds to α-1A receptors 3.9–38 times more selectively than α-1B and 3–20 \\r\\ntimes more selectively than α-1D. A significant effect on urinary flow with a reduced \\r\\nincidence of adverse reactions like orthostatic hypotension is allowed through this \\r\\nselectivity [28]. Tamsulosin is absorbed 90% in patients who are fasting. Taking the drug with \\r\\nfood increases the time to maximum concentration from 4 to 5 hours to 6–7 hours \\r\\nbut increases bioavailability by 30% and maximum plasma concentration by \\r\\n40–70% [28]. The drug is metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and 2D6 in the liver, with \\r\\nsome metabolism by other CYPs. There is a low rise in liver transaminases by tamsu-\\r\\nlosin, but clinically, apparent liver injury is rare [28]. The oral LD50 in rats is 650 mg/kg. In an overdose, the patients might have hypo-\\r\\ntension that should be managed supportively by lying supine, administering fluids, \\r\\nor if further progression occurs, vasopressors might be needed, and renal function \\r\\nshould be closely monitored. As tamsulosin is highly protein-bound, dialysis does not \\r\\nassist in treating overdose [28]. Animal studies have not shown any fetal harm caused by tamsulosin, but this \\r\\ndrug is not indicated for use in women. Tamsulosin is excreted in the milk of rats,\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"92812229-0ad2-40e8-a963-080893c56aab":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"92812229-0ad2-40e8-a963-080893c56aab\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"MaMnr+XTtXNL1U3w+Ttw65ZdrTV5ymyU+s1sAWCPrUs=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"3zL2B8LEVjXwOGw4KqoRZLFKDW4OpQdYlYMjaUQQeLI=\"}},\"hash\":\"R/hEt6e8/2O2CAlXdYbfQ/UDHLE1Td97QoDJE/9fWZM=\",\"text\":\"Topics in Autonomic Nervous System\\r\\n16\\r\\nbut no studies have been conducted about the effects of exposure to it.

Many organs have both β1 and β2 receptors coexisting (Table 1). For \\r\\nexample, approximately 80% of the receptors are of the β-1 subtype in a typical \\r\\nindividual heart. In heart failure, β1 receptors are downregulated, allowing a greater \\r\\nnumber of β2 receptors to be detected. The physiological and therapeutic effects \\r\\nof a β-blocker are determined by the actual quantity of β-1 or β-2 receptors in the \\r\\nvarious organs, the β-blocker’s affinity, and the local drug concentration. When the \\r\\nbioavailability of β-blockers with a strong affinity for β-adrenoceptors is not too low, \\r\\nthey can be helpful in small doses. Their effect persists even if they are washed out of \\r\\nthe extracellular area. As a result, the plasma half-life of the β-phase of elimination \\r\\ncannot forecast their duration of activity. This is particularly true for many medicines \\r\\nthat have a high affinity and a short plasma half-life (2–4 h for the β-phase).T26\\r\\nMany β-blockers have additional features that may influence their value in \\r\\nindividuals:\\r\\n1.

Pharmacology of the parasympathetic nervous system (PANS)\\r\\nThe PANS, often called the “rest and digest” system, conserves energy and \\r\\npromotes homeostasis during periods of relaxation. Acetylcholine is the primary \\r\\nneurotransmitter in PANS signaling, acting on cholinergic receptors in various tis-\\r\\nsues. Cholinergic receptors are divided into two major types: nicotinic and muscarinic \\r\\ncholinergic receptors [1]. Nicotinic receptors are found at the neuromuscular junction and in the SANS and \\r\\nPANS ganglia. Activation of these receptors leads to subsequent muscle contraction or \\r\\nneurotransmitter release [1]. Nicotinic agonists, such as nicotine, are used primarily in \\r\\nsmoking cessation therapies due to their stimulatory effects on the central nervous sys-\\r\\ntem [3]. In contrast, neuromuscular blocking agents, which act as nicotinic antagonists, \\r\\nare utilized in anesthesia to induce muscle relaxation during surgical procedures. Muscarinic receptors: Muscarinic receptors are further classified into five sub-\\r\\ntypes, M1–M5. The PANS innervates these receptors in various target tissues, includ-\\r\\ning the heart, smooth muscles, exocrine glands, and CNS structures. M1 receptors \\r\\nare predominantly located in the CNS, where their activation modulates cognitive \\r\\nfunction and memory. M2 receptors are primarily found in the heart, where activa-\\r\\ntion slows heart rate and reduces contractility. M3 receptors are abundant in smooth \\r\\nmuscles, glands, and endothelial cells. Stimulation of M3 receptors leads to broncho-\\r\\nconstriction, increased glandular secretions, and vasodilation. The clinical utility of muscarinic agonists is limited compared to their antagonists. However, muscarinic antagonists, also known as anticholinergic drugs, play a crucial \\r\\nrole in anesthesia. These agents, such as atropine and glycopyrrolate, counteract \\r\\nexcessive PANS activity during anesthesia induction; prevent unwanted bradycardia, \\r\\nreduce salivary, and bronchial secretions; and facilitate intubation [1]. 3.1 Parasympathomimetics\\r\\n3.1.1 Muscarinic receptor agonist\\r\\n3.1.1.1 Pilocarpine\\r\\nPilocarpine is a parasympathomimetic drug classified as a muscarinic receptor \\r\\nagonist.

Pilocarpine \\r\\nis available in various formulations, including eye drops, tablets, and solutions. Eye drops are commonly used for ophthalmic purposes. Concentrations may vary \\r\\ndepending on the specific indication. Storage conditions may involve protecting the \\r\\ndrug from light and excessive heat. Pilocarpine can be administered topically to the eye or orally. When applied \\r\\ntopically to the eye, it has poor systemic absorption. Oral pilocarpine is well-absorbed \\r\\nfrom the gastrointestinal tract. The drug undergoes hepatic metabolism, primarily via \\r\\nhydrolysis, and is excreted mainly in the urine. Pilocarpine selectively activates muscarinic receptors, predominantly the M3 \\r\\nsubtype. It stimulates cholinergic receptors in various tissues, leading to miosis \\r\\n(pupillary constriction), increased salivation, sweating, bronchoconstriction, and \\r\\ngastrointestinal motility. Clinically, pilocarpine eye drops are commonly used to treat glaucoma, where they \\r\\nreduce intraocular pressure by increasing the drainage of aqueous humor from the \\r\\neye. Pilocarpine can also manage dry mouth (xerostomia) associated with Sjögren’s \\r\\nsyndrome or radiation therapy. Pilocarpine is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity to \\r\\nthe drug, uncontrolled asthma, acute iritis, or narrow-angle glaucoma. It should be \\r\\nused cautiously in patients with cardiovascular diseases or gastrointestinal disor-\\r\\nders. Other common side effects of pilocarpine may include localized ocular effects \\r\\nlike temporary blurred vision, eye discomfort, or burning sensation when used \\r\\nas eye drops. Systemic effects can include increased sweating, increased saliva-\\r\\ntion, gastrointestinal disturbances (such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea), and \\r\\nbronchoconstriction. In cases of overdose or excessive use, pilocarpine can lead to excessive cholinergic \\r\\nstimulation. Symptoms may include profuse sweating, salivation, miosis, gastrointes-\\r\\ntinal distress, and potentially life-threatening cardiovascular effects. Treatment may \\r\\ninvolve discontinuing the drug, supportive measures, and administering atropine as a \\r\\ncompetitive antagonist to counteract the excessive muscarinic effects. 3.1.2 Acetyl-cholinesterase inhibitors\\r\\n3.1.2.1 Neostigmine\\r\\nNeostigmine is a reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, classified as a \\r\\n parasympathomimetic drug.

It increases the concentration of acetylcholine at cho-\\r\\nlinergic synapses by inhibiting the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, which breaks down \\r\\nacetylcholine. Rivastigmine is available in oral capsules, oral solutions, and trans-\\r\\ndermal patches. The capsules and oral solution come in various strengths, typically \\r\\n1.5–6 mg, while the transdermal patches are available in different doses. Rivastigmine can be administered orally or transdermally. When given orally, it \\r\\nis well-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. It undergoes extensive metabolism \\r\\nin the liver, and the elimination half-life varies depending on the individual’s genetic \\r\\nmakeup.

They work by blocking the muscarinic receptors \\r\\nof the parasympathetic system. Most drugs with parasympatholytic properties are \\r\\nanticholinergics [29]. Parasympatholytic’s pharmacodynamic effects include reduction of glandular \\r\\nsecretion, dilatation of the pupil, paralysis of accommodation, increase of intraocular \\r\\npressure, reduction of lacrimation, and more. These effects render parasympatholyt-\\r\\nics therapeutically valuable for treating slow heart rhythms, bronchioles constriction, \\r\\nand conditions such as benign prostatic hyperplasia, urinary retention, intestinal \\r\\natony, and tachycardia [29]. It is worth mentioning, however, that parasympatholytics \\r\\ncan interact with multiple drugs that can potentiate the antimuscarinic effect, such as \\r\\nantihistamines, neuroleptics, antidepressants, quinidine, or antiparkinson drugs [30]. Examples of parasympatholytics include atropine, methscopolamine bromide, \\r\\nflavoxate, orphenadrine, tiotropium, pinaverium, butylscopolamine, and anisoda-\\r\\nmine. However, atropine is the most used in the clinical setting. 3.2.1 Atropine\\r\\nAtropine is classified as an anticholinergic or a parasympatholytic drug. Clinically, \\r\\natropine is mainly indicated to treat bradyarrhythmias. Atropine also augments \\r\\ncardiac contractility by inhibiting cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase type 4, acting as \\r\\na positive inotropic agent. Atropine is a tropane alkaloid obtained from the deadly nightshade (Atropa bella-\\r\\ndonna) and other plants of the family Solanaceae. Its chemical formula is C17H23NO3, \\r\\nhas a molecular weight of 289.4 g/mol (Figure 2), and is a racemic mixture of equi-\\r\\nmolar concentrations of (S)- and (R)-atropine. Atropine contains several functional \\r\\ngroups, including an ester group, a hydroxyl group, and a tertiary amine group. The \\r\\nstructure of atropine can be diagrammatically represented as benzene acetic acid, α-(hydroxymethyl)-8-methyl-azabicyclo {3.2. 1} oct-3-yl ester endo-(±). On hydroly-\\r\\nsis, atropine gives (±)-tropic acid and tropine. Atropine is an antimuscarinic agent that acts as a reversible, nonspecific antago-\\r\\nnist of muscarinic receptors. It exerts its action by inhibiting the muscarinic actions \\r\\nof acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves and \\r\\nsmooth muscles, which respond to endogenous acetylcholine but are not so inner-\\r\\nvated. Atropine leads to both increased respiratory rate and depth, possibly due to \\r\\nthe drug-induced inhibition of the vagus nerve. Generally, atropine counteracts \\r\\nthe “rest and digest” activity of glands regulated by the parasympathetic nervous \\r\\nsystem. Common medical uses of atropine include its role as an antisialagogue during sur-\\r\\ngery and anesthesia. It is also available in eye drops to treat uveitis and early amblyo-\\r\\npia. Outside medicine, atropine is also used in the agricultural domain as a pesticide. The pharmacological effects of atropine are due to binding to muscarinic ace-\\r\\ntylcholine receptors. Atropine is a competitive, reversible antagonist at muscarinic \\r\\nreceptors, which blocks the effects of acetylcholine and other choline esters.

Atropine can cause several side effects, mild or severe, depending on the dose and \\r\\nthe individual’s response to the drug.

Conclusion\\r\\nIn conclusion, exploring autonomic nervous system (ANS) pharmacology \\r\\npresented in this chapter provides a comprehensive understanding of the intricate \\r\\ninterplay between neurotransmitters, receptors, and drugs within the sympathetic \\r\\nand parasympathetic divisions. This chapter unveils the complexity of ANS modula-\\r\\ntion by dissecting the mechanisms of both agonists and antagonists and delving into \\r\\ndirect and indirect drug actions. The broad spectrum of examples discussed underscores the significance of ANS \\r\\npharmacology across various medical disciplines. From managing hypotension and \\r\\nother medical problems, the clinical applications are far-reaching. The meticulous analy-\\r\\nsis of pharmacokinetics, metabolism, adverse effects, and contraindications empowers \\r\\nhealthcare professionals to make informed decisions that optimize patient care. For anesthesiologists, in particular, this knowledge is indispensable. The ability to \\r\\nfinely tune autonomic responses during procedures can significantly impact patient \\r\\noutcomes and safety. A robust understanding of ANS pharmacology is a cornerstone \\r\\nof any physician toolkit, enabling them to navigate the intricate balance of autonomic \\r\\ncontrol in the perioperative setting.

Whereas Comprehensive Pharmacy \\r\\n Review presents most of the subjects in the pharmacy cur-\\r\\nriculum in outline form with review questions interspersed, \\r\\nthis booklet off ers two examinations that are similar in for-\\r\\nmat and coverage to those in the licensing examination re-\\r\\nquired of all pharmacists. Both patient profi le–based and free-standing test items \\r\\nare included in the examinations. Th  e questions are of two \\r\\ngeneral types. In the fi rst type (Example 1), the correct re-\\r\\nsponse most accurately completes a statement or answers \\r\\na question. In the second type (Example 2), three state-\\r\\nments are given. Th  e correct answer may include one, two, \\r\\nor all three of these statements; these questions are to be \\r\\nanswered according to the direction block that accompa-\\r\\nnies them. EXAMPLE 1 (MULTIPLE-CHOICE)\\r\\nDrugs that demonstrate nonlinear pharmacokinetics show \\r\\nwhich of the following properties? A. A constant ratio of drug metabolites is formed as the \\r\\n administered dose increases. B. Th  e elimination half-life increases as the administered \\r\\ndose is increased. C. Th  e area under the curve (AUC) increases in direct pro-\\r\\nportion to an increase in the administered dose. D. Both low and high doses follow fi rst-order  elimination \\r\\nkinetics. E. Th  e steady-state drug concentration increases in direct \\r\\nproportion to the dosing rate. Preface\\r\\nEXAMPLE 2 (MULTIPLE TRUE–FALSE)\\r\\nAntimuscarinic agents are used in the treatment of Parkin-\\r\\nson disease and in the control of some neuroleptic-induced \\r\\nextrapyramidal disorders. Th  ese agents include which of the \\r\\nfollowing? I. ipratropium\\r\\n II. benztropine\\r\\n III. trihexyphenidyl\\r\\nI only\\r\\nIII only\\r\\nI and II\\r\\nII and III\\r\\nI, II, and III\\r\\nAllow a maximum of 4 hours for each examination. Answers, with explanations, are given at the end of each test. Additional cases, questions, and calculations exercises are \\r\\nincluded following the two practice tests. Also, several ap-\\r\\npendices are included at the back of the book for reference.

Instructors do not like to prepare tests, and \\r\\nstudents do not like to take them. However, students are required to take many exami-\\r\\nnations during their learning careers, and little if any time \\r\\nis spent acquainting them with the positive aspects of tests \\r\\nand with systematic and successful methods for approach-\\r\\ning them. Students perceive tests as punitive and sometimes \\r\\nfeel as if they were merely opportunities for the instructor to \\r\\ndiscover what the student has forgotten or has never learned. Students need to view tests as opportunities to display their \\r\\nknowledge and to use them as tools for developing prescrip-\\r\\ntions for further study and learning. While preparing for any exam, class and board exams \\r\\nas well as practice exams, it is important that students learn \\r\\nas much as they can about the subject they will be tested and \\r\\nare prepared to discover just how much they may not know. Students should study to acquire knowledge, not just to pre-\\r\\npare for tests. For the well-prepared student, the chances of \\r\\npassing far exceed the chances of failing. MATERIALS NEEDED FOR TEST \\r\\nPREPARATION\\r\\nIn preparing for a test, most students collect far too much \\r\\nstudy material, only to fi nd that they simply do not have time \\r\\nto go through all of it. Th  ey are defeated before they begin \\r\\nbecause either they cannot get through all the material, leav-\\r\\ning areas unstudied, or they race through the material so \\r\\nquickly that they cannot benefi t from the activity. It is generally more effi  cient for the student to use ma-\\r\\nterials already at hand—that is, class notes, one good outline \\r\\nto cover and strengthen all areas and to quickly review the \\r\\nwhole topic, and one good text as a reference for complex \\r\\nmaterial that requires further explanation. Also, many students attempt to memorize far too \\r\\nmuch information, rather than learning and  understanding \\r\\nless material and then relying on that learned information \\r\\nto determine the answers to questions at the time of the \\r\\nTaking a Test\\r\\n examination. Relying too heavily on memorized material \\r\\ncauses anxiety, and the more anxious students become dur-\\r\\ning a test, the less learned knowledge they are likely to use. ATTITUDE AND APPROACH\\r\\nA positive attitude and a realistic approach are essential to \\r\\nsuccessful test taking. If the student concentrates on the neg-\\r\\native aspects of tests or on the potential for failure, anxiety \\r\\nincreases and performance decreases. A negative attitude \\r\\ngenerally develops if the student concentrates on “I must \\r\\npass” rather than on “I can pass. ” “What if I fail? ” becomes \\r\\nthe major factor motivating the student to run from failure \\r\\nrather than toward success. Th  is results from placing too \\r\\nmuch emphasis on scores. Th  e score received is only one \\r\\n aspect of test performance. Test performance also indicates \\r\\nthe student’s ability to use diff erential reasoning. In each question with fi ve alternatives, of which one is \\r\\ncorrect, there are four alternatives that are incorrect. If de-\\r\\nductive reasoning is used, the choices can be viewed as hav-\\r\\ning possibilities of being correct. Th  e elimination of wrong \\r\\nchoices increases the odds that a student will be able to rec-\\r\\nognize the correct choice. Even if the correct choice does \\r\\nnot become evident, the probability of guessing correctly \\r\\n increases. Eliminating incorrect choices on a test can result \\r\\nin choosing the correct answer. Answering questions based on what is incorrect is diffi  -\\r\\ncult for many students because they have had nearly 20 years \\r\\nof experience taking tests with the implied assertion that \\r\\nknowledge can be displayed only by knowing what is correct. It must be remembered, however, that students can display \\r\\nknowledge by knowing something is wrong, just as they can \\r\\ndisplay it by knowing something is right. PREPARING FOR THE EXAMINATION\\r\\n1. Study for yourself. Although some of the material may \\r\\nseem irrelevant, the more you learn now, the less you will \\r\\nhave to learn later. Also, do not let the fear of the test rob \\r\\nyou of an important part of your education. If you study \\r\\nxi\\r\\nMutnick_00_FM.indd   xiMutnick_00_FM.indd   xi07/16/12   2:46 PM07/16/12   2:46 PM\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"9b8dd693-f000-48e4-9750-b5dc15adf73e":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"9b8dd693-f000-48e4-9750-b5dc15adf73e\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"7ZwmBKwZ7Jp0LVUhguzwCJ6xmHGnFcb8ld+q/nTdAVI=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"+B7LaTYh+xFc0Tf4Emi93bs2em3OYFBuRWVrcxelE9k=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"82b782b6-5ce5-4b4c-aadf-f1f884b03b63\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"5K+ZUas4EBX/GfTG5Gd3Ka6KK3TIjF6OJdWMGbi6C74=\"}},\"hash\":\"llDTF/VzQnxWYb+7pJ5nLKjqxCUuJqSYi2zs/wMS69A=\",\"text\":\"xii Taking a Test\\r\\nto learn, the task is less distasteful than studying solely to \\r\\npass a test. 2. Review all areas. You should not be selective by study-\\r\\ning perceived weak areas and ignoring perceived strong \\r\\nareas. Cover all of the material, putting added emphasis \\r\\non weak areas. 3. Attempt to understand, not just to memorize, the ma-\\r\\nterial. Ask yourself: To whom does the material apply? When does it apply? Where does it apply? How does it \\r\\napply? Understanding the connections among these \\r\\npoints allows for longer retention and aids in those situa-\\r\\ntions when guessing strategies may be needed. 4. Try to anticipate questions that might appear on the \\r\\ntest. Ask yourself how you might construct a question on \\r\\na specifi c topic. 5. Give yourself a couple days of rest before the test. Studying up to the last moment will increase your anxiety \\r\\nand cause potential confusion. TAKING THE EXAMINATION\\r\\n1. Be sure to pace yourself to use the test time optimally. You \\r\\nshould use all of your allotted time; if you fi nish too early, \\r\\nyou probably did so by moving too quickly through the test. 2. Read each question and all the alternatives carefully be-\\r\\nfore you begin to make decisions. Remember, the ques-\\r\\ntions contain clues, as do the answer choices. 3. Read the directions for each question set carefully. You \\r\\nwould be amazed at how many students make mistakes \\r\\nin tests simply because they have not paid close attention \\r\\nto the directions. 4. It is not advisable to leave blanks with the intention of com-\\r\\ning back to answer questions later. If you feel that you must \\r\\ncome back to a question, mark the best choice and place \\r\\na note in the margin. Generally speaking, it is best not to \\r\\nchange answers once you have made a decision. Your con-\\r\\nsidered reaction and fi rst response are correct more oft en \\r\\nthan are changes made out of frustration or anxiety. 5. Do not let anxiety destroy your confi dence. If you have \\r\\nprepared conscientiously, you know enough to pass. Use \\r\\nall that you have learned. 6. Do not try to determine how well you are doing as you \\r\\nproceed. You will not be able to make an objective assess-\\r\\nment, and your anxiety will increase. 7. Do not become frustrated or angry about what appear to \\r\\nbe bad or diffi  cult questions. You simply do not know the \\r\\nanswers; you cannot know everything. SPECIFIC TEST-TAKING STRATEGIES\\r\\nRead the entire question carefully, regardless of format. Test \\r\\nquestions have multiple parts. Concentrate on picking out the \\r\\npertinent key words that will help you problem-solve. Words \\r\\nsuch as always, all, never, mostly, primarily, and so forth play \\r\\nsignifi cant roles. In all types of questions,  distractors with \\r\\nterms such as always or never most oft en are incorrect. Ad-\\r\\njectives and adverbs can completely change the meaning of \\r\\nquestions—pay close attention to them. Th  e knowledge and \\r\\napplication of grammar oft  en are key to dissecting questions. Multiple-Choice Questions\\r\\nRead the question and the choices carefully to become fa-\\r\\nmiliar with the data provided. Remember, in multiple-choice \\r\\nquestions there is one correct answer and there are four dis-\\r\\ntractors, or incorrect answers. (Distractors are plausible and \\r\\npossibly correct, or they would not be called distractors. ) \\r\\nTh  ey are generally correct for part of the question but not for \\r\\nthe entire question. Dissecting the question into parts helps \\r\\neliminate distractors. Many students think that they must always start at option \\r\\nA and make a decision before they move to B, thus forcing de-\\r\\ncisions they are not ready to make. Your fi rst decisions should \\r\\nbe made on those choices you feel the most confi dent about. Compare the choices with each part of the question. To \\r\\nbe wrong, a choice needs to be incorrect for only part of the \\r\\nquestion. To be correct, it must be totally correct. If you be-\\r\\nlieve a choice is partially incorrect, tentatively eliminate that \\r\\nchoice. Make notes next to the choices regarding tentative \\r\\ndecisions. One method is to place a minus sign next to the \\r\\nchoices you are certain are incorrect and a plus sign next \\r\\nto those that potentially are correct. Finally, place a zero next \\r\\nto any choice you do not understand or need to come back to \\r\\nfor further inspection.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"82b782b6-5ce5-4b4c-aadf-f1f884b03b63":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"82b782b6-5ce5-4b4c-aadf-f1f884b03b63\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"7ZwmBKwZ7Jp0LVUhguzwCJ6xmHGnFcb8ld+q/nTdAVI=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"+B7LaTYh+xFc0Tf4Emi93bs2em3OYFBuRWVrcxelE9k=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"9b8dd693-f000-48e4-9750-b5dc15adf73e\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"llDTF/VzQnxWYb+7pJ5nLKjqxCUuJqSYi2zs/wMS69A=\"}},\"hash\":\"5K+ZUas4EBX/GfTG5Gd3Ka6KK3TIjF6OJdWMGbi6C74=\",\"text\":\"Do not feel that you must make fi nal \\r\\ndecisions until you have examined all choices carefully.

Guessing\\r\\nNothing takes the place of a fi rm knowledge base, but hav-\\r\\ning little information to work with, you may fi nd it necessary \\r\\nto guess at the correct answer. A few simple rules can help \\r\\nincrease your guessing accuracy. Always guess consistently if \\r\\nyou have no idea what is correct—that is, aft  er eliminating all \\r\\nthat you can, make the choice that agrees with your intuition \\r\\nor choose the option closest to the top of the list that has not \\r\\nbeen eliminated as a potential answer. When guessing at questions that present with choices in \\r\\nnumeric form, you will oft en fi nd the choices listed in an as-\\r\\ncending or descending order. It is generally not wise to guess \\r\\nthe fi rst or last alternative because these are usually extreme \\r\\nvalues and are most likely incorrect. USING A PRACTICE EXAM TO LEARN\\r\\nAll too oft en, students do not take full advantage of practice \\r\\nexams. Th  ere is a tendency to complete the exam, score it, \\r\\nlook up the correct answer to those questions missed, and \\r\\nthen forget the entire thing. In fact, great educational benefi  ts could be derived if stu-\\r\\ndents would spend more time using practice tests as learn-\\r\\ning tools. As mentioned previously, incorrect choices in test \\r\\nquestions are plausible and partially correct, or they would \\r\\nnot fulfi ll their purpose as distractors. Th  is means that it is \\r\\njust as benefi cial to look up the incorrect choices as the cor-\\r\\nrect choices to discover specifi  cally why they are incorrect. In \\r\\nthis way, it is possible to learn better test-taking skills as the \\r\\nsubtlety of question construction is uncovered. In addition, it is advisable to go back and attempt to re-\\r\\nstructure each question to see if all the choices can be made \\r\\ncorrect by modifying the question. By doing this, you will \\r\\nlearn four times as much. By all means, look up the right \\r\\nanswer and explanation. Th  en, focus on each of the other \\r\\nchoices, and ask yourself under what conditions, if any, they \\r\\nmight be correct. SUMMARY\\r\\nIdeally, examinations are designed to determine how much \\r\\nmaterial students have learned and how that material is used \\r\\nin the successful completion of the examination. Students \\r\\nwill be successful if these suggestions are followed:\\r\\n•    Develop a positive attitude, and maintain that attitude. •   Be realistic in determining the amount of material you \\r\\n attempt to master and in the score you hope to attain. •   Read the directions for each type of question and the \\r\\nquestions themselves closely, and follow the directions \\r\\ncarefully. • Bring diff erential reasoning to each question in the \\r\\n examination. • Guess intelligently and consistently when guessing \\r\\n strategies must be used. •   Use the test as an opportunity to display your knowledge \\r\\nand as a tool for developing prescriptions for further \\r\\nstudy and learning. Board examinations are not easy. Th  ey may be almost \\r\\nimpossible for those who have unrealistic expectations or \\r\\nfor those who allow misinformation concerning the exams \\r\\nto produce anxiety out of proportion to the task at hand. Examinations are manageable if they are approached with a \\r\\npositive attitude and with consistent use of all of the informa-\\r\\ntion the student has learned. Michael J.

Th  e standards of competence for the \\r\\npractice of pharmacy are set by each state board of  pharmacy. NAPLEX—Th e North American Pharmacist  Licensure \\r\\n Examination—is the principal instrument used by the state \\r\\nboard of pharmacy to assess the knowledge and profi ciency \\r\\nnecessary for a candidate to practice pharmacy. Th e National \\r\\nAssociation of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP) is an independent, \\r\\ninternational, and impartial association that assists member \\r\\nboards and jurisdictions in developing,  implementing, and \\r\\nenforcing uniform standards for the purpose of protecting \\r\\nthe public health. NABP develops examinations that enable \\r\\nboards of pharmacy to assess the  competence of candidates \\r\\nseeking licensure to practice pharmacy. Each state board of \\r\\npharmacy may impose additional examinations. Th  e two ma-\\r\\njor examinations developed by NABP are\\r\\n• Th  e North American Pharmacist Licensure Examination \\r\\n(NAPLEX)\\r\\n•    Multistate Pharmacy Jurisprudence Examination (MPJE)\\r\\nForeign pharmacy graduates must pass the Foreign \\r\\nPharmacy Graduate Equivalency Examination (FPGEE) as \\r\\npart of the Foreign Pharmacy Graduate Equivalency Cer-\\r\\ntifi cation process. Foreign-educated pharmacists  awarded \\r\\n FPGEC   Certifi cation are considered to have partially ful-\\r\\nfi  lled eligibility requirements for licensure in those states that \\r\\naccept the certifi cation. A description of these computerized examinations and \\r\\nregistration information may be found on the NABP  website \\r\\nonline at www.nabp.net. Before submitting registration \\r\\n materials, the pharmacy candidate should contact the board \\r\\nof pharmacy for additional information regarding proce-\\r\\ndures, deadline dates, and required documentation. Th  e NAPLEX is a computer-adaptive test. Th ese ques-\\r\\ntions measure the prospective pharmacist’s ability to measure \\r\\npharmacotherapy and therapeutic outcomes, prepare and dis-\\r\\npense medications, and implement and evaluate information \\r\\nfor optimal health care. Th  e computer adaptive exam tests a \\r\\ncandidate’s knowledge and ability by assessing the answers \\r\\nbefore presenting the next test question. If the answer is cor-\\r\\nrect, the computer will select a more diffi  cult question from \\r\\nthe test item pool in an appropriate content area; if the an-\\r\\nswer is incorrect, an easier question will be selected by the \\r\\ncomputer. Th  e NAPLEX score is based on the diffi  culty level \\r\\nof the questions answered correctly. NAPLEX consists of 185 multiple-choice test questions. 150 questions are used to calculate the test score. Th e remain-\\r\\ning 35 items served as pretest questions and do not aff ect the \\r\\nNAPLEX score. Pretest questions are administered to evalu-\\r\\nate the item’s diffi  culty level for possible inclusion as a scored \\r\\nquestion in future exams. Th  ese pretest questions are dis-\\r\\npersed throughout the exam and cannot be identifi ed by the \\r\\ncandidate. A majority of the questions on the NAPLEX are \\r\\nasked in a scenario-based format (i.e., patient profi les  with \\r\\naccompanying test questions). To properly analyze and an-\\r\\nswer the questions presented, the candidate must refer to the \\r\\ninformation provided in the patient profi le. Some questions \\r\\nappear in a standalone format and should be answered solely \\r\\nfrom the information provided in the question.

Th  e answer is C (I and II). Th  e potential problem is \\r\\nthe drug interaction between gemfi brozil and simvastatin. Th  e combination of gemfi brozil and simvastatin has been \\r\\n associated with an increased risk of myopathy and rhabdo-\\r\\nmyolysis. One would need to know the lipid panel results to \\r\\ndetermine the necessity of both agents being used together \\r\\ndue to the marked severity of this interaction. 2. Th  e answer is A (I only). Doxazosin in doses of  2 to \\r\\n8   mg/day was one of the treatment arms in ALLHAT, and \\r\\nthe  treatment was discontinued prematurely owing to an \\r\\n apparent 25% increase in the incidence of combined car-\\r\\ndiovascular disease outcomes compared to patients in the \\r\\n control group receiving the diuretic chlorthalidone. Th e \\r\\n added risks for heart failure, stroke, and coronary heart \\r\\n disease were the major outcomes of the doxazosin arm. 3. Th   e answer is E (I, II, and III). Th   e JNC-7 provided a table \\r\\nof compelling indications that suggested specifi  c drug  therapy \\r\\nin select patients rather than the use of standard  suggested \\r\\nguidelines. Included as compelling indications, and their \\r\\nrespective therapy, are heart failure (diuretics, \\u0004-blockers, \\r\\nACE inhibitors, ARBs, aldosterone antagonists), post-MI \\r\\n(\\u0004-blockers, ACE inhibitors, aldosterone antagonists), high \\r\\ncoronary disease risk (diuretics, \\u0004-blockers, ACE inhibitors, \\r\\ncalcium-channel blockers), diabetes (diuretics, \\u0004-blockers, \\r\\nACE inhibitors, ARBs, calcium-channel  blockers), chronic \\r\\nkidney disease (ACE inhibitors, ARBs), and recurrent stroke \\r\\nprevention (diuretics, ACE inhibitors). 4. Th  e answer is C (I and II). \\u0004-Adrenergic blockers such \\r\\nas metoprolol are indicated in post-MI patients, where they \\r\\nhave been shown to signifi cantly reduce sudden death and \\r\\noverall mortality. In addition, they have been suggested by \\r\\nthe JNC-7 guidelines as therapeutic options in hyperten-\\r\\nsive patients with the following compelling indications for \\r\\ntheir use instead of standard suggested therapy: heart failure, \\r\\npost-MI, high-risk coronary disease patients, and diabetes. Ms. Honors, as a post-MI patient with hypertension, would \\r\\nbe a candidate for metoprolol. 5. Th  e answer is E (I, II, and III). Th rombolytic agents \\r\\n (rt-PA, r-PA, TNKase) have been used in patients with \\r\\nSTEMI who have had chest pain for \\b 6 to 12 hours. Suc-\\r\\ncessful early reperfusion has been shown to reduce infarct \\r\\nsize, improve ventricular function, and improve mortality. Benefi ts may be seen in patients using thrombolytic therapy \\r\\nas late as 12 hours aft er pain starts. Th  e use of thrombolyt-\\r\\nics may  restore blood fl ow in an occluded artery if adminis-\\r\\ntered within 12 hours of an acute MI, although \\b 6 hours is \\r\\n optimal. Th  e goal of  treatment of STEMI patients is to initi-\\r\\nate thrombolytic therapy within 30 to 60 minutes of arrival \\r\\nin an emergency room. Most studies have shown that each \\r\\nagent, when used early, can reopen (reperfuse) occluded cor-\\r\\nonary arteries and reduce mortality from STEMI. However, \\r\\nconsiderations such as ease of use, onset of action, incidence \\r\\nof bleed, and cost are important in determining which agent \\r\\nis used in a given hospital and given patient. 6. Th  e answer is B (III only). Clopidogrel possesses an-\\r\\ntithrombotic eff ects and is recommended to prevent the \\r\\n development of acute coronary syndromes. I and II are \\r\\n incorrect. 7. Th e answer is B. Rabeprazole (Aciphex) is a proton \\r\\npump inhibitor (PPI), which among other indications (duo-\\r\\ndenal ulcer, erosive gastritis, hypersecretory conditions, and \\r\\ntreatment of Helicobacter pylori infections) is primarily indi-\\r\\ncated for the treatment of GERD. Current recommendations \\r\\nsuggest a dosage of 20 mg by mouth daily. 8.

She has stage II hypertension. JNC-7 \\r\\nguidelines include four blood pressure classes (normal, \\r\\n prehypertension, stage I hypertension, and stage II hyper-\\r\\ntension); the classes are based on patient’s blood pressure \\r\\n readings and are linked to current treatment recommenda-\\r\\ntions.

Prehypertension (systolic 120 to 139 \\r\\nor diastolic of 80 to 89 mm Hg) again requires no antihyper-\\r\\ntensive treatment unless the patient has a compelling indica-\\r\\ntion. In stage I hypertension (systolic 140 to 159 or diastolic \\r\\n90 to 99  mm Hg), thiazide-type diuretics are indicated for \\r\\nmost patients, although patients with compelling indications \\r\\nwould be candidates for other agents.

Half- normal saline solution \\r\\n(0.45% sodium chloride) has an osmotic pressure less than \\r\\nthat of blood and is referred to as a hypotonic solution. 14. Th  e answer is B. Anemia is a common complication of \\r\\nchronic kidney disease caused by a decrease in erythropoi-\\r\\netin, an endocrine product produced in the kidney. Eryth-\\r\\nropoietin, stimulates red blood cell production in the bone \\r\\nmarrow. Th   is is refl ected by an increase in hematocrit and he-\\r\\nmoglobin and a decrease in the need for blood transfusions. 15. Th   e answer is D (II and III). Insulin resistance can oc-\\r\\ncur in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes patients so statement \\r\\nI is incorrect. Th  e other two statements about insulin resis-\\r\\ntance are correct. 16. Th  e answer is C (I and II). Lanolin is the waxy sub-\\r\\nstance that is secreted by the sebaceous glands of sheep and \\r\\n deposited onto the sheep wool fi bers. It is found in many \\r\\nOTC moisturizing products and serves as an emollient oc-\\r\\nclusive fi  lm that can prevent water loss from the skin through \\r\\n evaporation. 17. Th e answer is A. Both bismuth subsalicylate and \\r\\n loperamide are considered safe and eff ective. Adsorbents \\r\\n(pectin and attapulgite) that have been used in OTC antidi-\\r\\narrheal products in the past have not been shown to be eff ec-\\r\\ntive. Kaolin, another adsorbent, has been shown to be safe \\r\\nand eff ective by itself, but there are no OTC products on the \\r\\nmarket that contain only kaolin. 18. Th   e answer is E (I, II, and III). Levodopa  crosses the \\r\\nblood–brain barrier. It is converted to dopamine where \\r\\nit  exerts its eff ects in Parkinson disease. Levodopa is me-\\r\\ntabolized centrally and peripherally to dopamine by dopa \\r\\ndecarboxylase. Carbidopa does not cross the blood–brain \\r\\nbarrier and inhibits peripheral decarboxylation of levodo-\\r\\npa. Th erefore, more levodopa is available for  transport \\r\\nto the brain, and the peripheral side eff ects are reduced. Sinemet combines the antiparkinsonian eff ects of levodo-\\r\\npa with the dopamine metabolism-inhibiting eff ects  of \\r\\ncarbidopa. 19. Th  e answer is E (I, II, and III). Drugs that are highly \\r\\nbound to albumin will have higher concentrations of free \\r\\ndrug  circulating in the blood if albumin levels are reduced. Hypoalbuminemia, liver (hepatic) disease, malnutrition, and \\r\\ncancer are several of the more common conditions that result \\r\\nin decreased albumin levels, which necessitate alterations in \\r\\ndosage in highly albumin-bound drugs. 20. Th  e answer is A. Th  e action of salmeterol is that of \\r\\na sympathomimetic agonist with high \\u00042 selectivity. Th e \\r\\ncombinations are indicated for most patients (thiazide-type \\r\\ndiuretic and ACE inhibitor, ARB, \\u0004-blocker, or calcium-\\r\\nchannel blocker). Ms. Honors’ BP (162/104) indicates that \\r\\nshe has stage II hypertension and she is receiving a diuretic, \\r\\na \\u0004-blocker, and an ACE inhibitor. 10. Th  e answer is D (II & III). Th  ere is not any informa-\\r\\ntion in the profi le that would prevent the use of acetamino-\\r\\nphen. NSAIDs (ibuprofen and celecoxib) may decrease the \\r\\n eff ectiveness of her antihypertensive therapy and may cause \\r\\nan increased risk of myocardial infarction in this patient. 11.

Atheromatous lesions in the coronary arter-\\r\\nies lead to decreased blood fl ow, resulting in angina pectoris \\r\\nand MI; sudden death may ensue. Renal eff ects: decreased \\r\\nblood fl ow leads to an increase in renin-aldosterone secre-\\r\\ntion, which heightens the reabsorption of sodium and  water \\r\\nand  increases blood volume.

Th  e answer is A. Amiloride. In an otherwise healthy \\r\\npatient with stage I hypertension, thiazide diuretics are con-\\r\\nsidered the fi rst-line treatment of choice for most patients. In patients who might have a compelling indication, such \\r\\nas renal disease, stroke, high-risk cardiovascular disease, \\r\\nor diabetes mellitus, other agents have been recommended. Amiloride is a potassium-sparing diuretic and is not indi-\\r\\ncated over thiazide diuretics as fi rst-line therapy.

Th  e answer is E (I, II, and III). Ramipril (Altace) is an \\r\\nACE inhibitor. Recent clinical guidelines recommend the use \\r\\nof ACE inhibitors in all patients with heart failure owing to \\r\\nleft  ventricular systolic dysfunction, unless they have a con-\\r\\ntraindication to their use or have demonstrated intolerance \\r\\nto their use.

Th  e Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) trial \\r\\n demonstrated that the ACE inhibitor ramipril (10 mg/day) \\r\\nreduced cardiovascular death, MI, and stroke in patients \\u000b 55 \\r\\nyears of age who were at high risk for or had  vascular disease \\r\\nin the  absence of heart failure. ACE inhibitors have also been \\r\\nshown to be benefi cial in patients who have  chronic kidney \\r\\ndisease, in whom they can reduce the onset of  deteriorating \\r\\nrenal function. Each of the three  conditions—hypertension, \\r\\nheart failure, and chronic  kidney disease—have now been \\r\\nshown to benefi t from the use of ACE inhibitors such as \\r\\nramipril. However, caution is still required; patients should \\r\\nbe monitored for elevations in  potassium levels and a poten-\\r\\ntial reduction in renal function indicators (serum creatinine). 26. Th  e answer is B. Ferrous sulfate is available in the \\r\\n hydrous form as a 325-mg tablet. Th  e preparation contains \\r\\n20% elemental iron. Consequently, 325 mg given three times \\r\\na day would equal 0.20 \\n 3 \\n 325 mg, or 195 mg per day. Other available salts that contain varying degrees of elemen-\\r\\ntal iron are ferrous gluconate, 12%; ferrous fumarate, 33%; \\r\\nand ferrous sulfate (desiccated), 30%. 27. Th  e answer is C (I and II). Clopidogrel is a thieno-\\r\\npyridine derivative related to ticlopidine, but it possesses \\r\\nantithrombotic eff ects greater than those of ticlopidine. Th e \\r\\nmost recent national guidelines for ST-segment elevated \\r\\nmyocardial infarction (STEMI) state that clopidogrel should \\r\\nbe added to aspirin in STEMI patients regardless of wheth-\\r\\ner they undergo reperfusion with fi brinolytics or do not \\r\\n receive reperfusion. Doses of 75 mg by mouth daily should \\r\\nbe  administered and treatment should continue for at least \\r\\n14 days. However, long-term maintenance therapy for up to \\r\\n1 year can be used as well. 28. Th  e answer is C (I and II). Enalapril (Vasotec), capto-\\r\\npril (Capoten), lisinopril (Zestril and Prinivil), benazepril \\r\\n( Lotensin), fosinopril (Monopril), quinapril (Accupril), \\r\\nramipril (Altace), moexipril (Univasc), and trandolapril \\r\\n(Mavik) are the ACE inhibitors currently on the market. lung contains \\u00042-receptors, which are responsible for the \\r\\n relaxation of tracheal and bronchial muscles. In contrast, \\r\\n\\u00041-receptors are in the heart and are responsible for chrono-\\r\\ntropic (rate) and inotropic (contraction force) eff ects. Salme-\\r\\nterol gives the asthmatic patient maximal bronchodilation \\r\\nwith minimal stimulation of cardiac receptors. 21. Th   e answer is A (I). Diff erent age groups have common \\r\\nunderlying causes for the development of heart failure. Th e \\r\\npatient in this case is 54 years of age and has no history of MI \\r\\nas a possible cause, which is a leading cause of heart failure in \\r\\npeople aged 40 to 50 years. Drugs such as corticosteroids have \\r\\nbeen implicated as causative agents in the development of \\r\\nheart failure owing to their ability to cause sodium and water \\r\\nretention.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"aba6d325-8e97-4141-a4ba-2fe9b9eb78f4":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"aba6d325-8e97-4141-a4ba-2fe9b9eb78f4\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"d17UK5QpM9E4X5XfRpnVn1F+oIs98vAIGIN8VrUyi9I=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"liSjvpmwv4jjeC/Oi3MOYDpHq6MO7QPaff8xyba+aoA=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"234b7708-89b9-4652-9901-340fbe1a2936\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"yBULXvsyPrJdPSWbs/+3Jy5lQg2ZLAZ5Ubxfj7QypO8=\"}},\"hash\":\"3UnXENcVA786HVTCYwC9rvcx3aERVg2PZVBJSWhSXhY=\",\"text\":\"In both of these cases, metabolic demands placed \\r\\non the heart normally do not increase; however, the heart is \\r\\nstill unable to meet them (low output). Mr. Mutrick has a sec-\\r\\nondary diagnosis of anemia (possibly caused by  steroid use), \\r\\nwhich increases the metabolic demands placed on a heart \\r\\nthat is already unable to meet such demands (high output). 22. Th  e answer is D (II and III). On receiving the prescrip-\\r\\ntions on 8/10, the pharmacist should have called the physi-\\r\\ncian’s offi  ce for assurance that the potassium supplement was \\r\\ntruly warranted owing to the documentation of chronic kid-\\r\\nney disease. Potassium elimination depends on the kidney, \\r\\nand declining function means the ability to  excrete potassium \\r\\nis reduced. In addition, based on updated treatment guide-\\r\\nlines, the pharmacist would be justifi ed in discussing the po-\\r\\ntential role for a \\u0004-adrenergic blocker in this type of patient. Its merits may very well extend beyond those appreciated in \\r\\nheart failure, including hypertension as  compelling  condition. 23. Th  e answer is D (II and III). Carvedilol (Coreg) is a \\r\\n\\u0004-adrenergic receptor blocker that is indicated in the treat-\\r\\nment of hypertension and heart failure. When used in the \\r\\ntreatment of heart failure, as in Mr. Mutrick, doses must be \\r\\nslowly and closely titrated up to the maximal dosage every \\r\\n2 weeks as tolerated. Th  e pharmacist was able to identify that \\r\\nthere were no prescriptions on fi le for Mr. Mutrick for Coreg \\r\\nand there were no refi lls provided with the initial prescrip-\\r\\ntion of Coreg 3.125 mg. Th  is has the potential for leaving \\r\\nthe patient without his medication at the end of the 2-week \\r\\n period.

Th   e answer is E. Similar to ACE inhibitors, \\u0004-adrenergic \\r\\nblockers work through actions of the endogenous neurohor-\\r\\nmonal system. Unlike ACE inhibitors, which work strictly \\r\\nby blocking the eff ects of the renin–angiotensin system, \\r\\n\\u0004-adrenergic blockers work by interfering with the sympa-\\r\\nthetic nervous system. Th  is has prompted the use of three dif-\\r\\nferent types of \\u0004-adrenergic blockers: those that are relatively \\r\\nselective toward \\u00041-receptors (e.g., metoprolol); those that \\r\\nare selective to both \\u00041- and \\u00042-receptors (e.g., propranolol \\r\\nand bucindolol); and those that are selective to \\u00041-, \\u00042-, and \\r\\n\\u00051-receptors (e.g., carvedilol). \\u0004-Adrenergic blockers, similar \\r\\nto ACE inhibitors, have been shown to decrease the risk of \\r\\ndeath and hospitalization as well as improve the clinical status \\r\\nof heart failure patients. Current guidelines recommend the \\r\\nuse of a \\u0004-adrenergic blocker in all patients with stable heart \\r\\nfailure owing to left  ventricular dysfunction, unless they have \\r\\na contraindication to their use or are unable to tolerate their \\r\\neff ects because of hypotension, bradycardia, bronchospasm, \\r\\nand the like. 34. Th   e answer is C. Atropine in therapeutic doses  inhibits \\r\\ncholinergic impulses and increases the heart rate. When \\r\\ntreatment is initiated in a patient with sinus bradycardia, ini-\\r\\ntial small doses may actually stimulate cholinergic receptors \\r\\nand therefore increase the degree of bradycardia. Constipa-\\r\\ntion, dry mouth, decreased secretions, and pupillary dila-\\r\\ntion are all side eff ects associated with anticholinergic drugs. Rarely do single doses of atropine cause constipation. 35. Th   e answer is E (I, II, and III). Although the branded \\r\\nversion of Quinaglute is no longer available, currently there \\r\\nare several extended-release generic quinidine gluconate \\r\\nproducts on the market to fi ll this gap. Quinidine is a class \\r\\nIA  antiarrhythmic agent, with GI intolerance as one of its \\r\\nmore troubling side eff ects. Th  e extended-release quinidine \\r\\ngluconate products have been marketed as a way to reduce \\r\\nthe GI eff ects while providing a more sustained, consistent \\r\\nquinidine level with less fl uctuations and lower peak eff ects. Carvedilol (Coreg) is a \\u0004-adrenergic blocker and is indicat-\\r\\ned in the treatment of heart failure and is currently available \\r\\nas a  rapid-release  product (Coreg) and an extended-release \\r\\nproduct (Coreg CR). Felodipine (Plendil) is considered an \\r\\nextended-release product and is used in the treatment of \\r\\nhypertension. It is one of the second-generation calcium-\\r\\nchannel blocking agents and is not indicated as an antiar-\\r\\nrhythmic agent. 36. Th  e answer is D. Inamrinone is a bipyridine agent that \\r\\nhas both positive inotropic eff ects and vasodilating eff ects. It does off er an alternative to dopamine and dobutamine and \\r\\nTh  e agents as a group have the same general pharmacologic \\r\\neff ects by blocking the actions of the converting enzyme, \\r\\nwhich converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II (a potent \\r\\n vasoconstrictor), thereby reducing aft erload and inhibiting \\r\\naldosterone release from the adrenal gland. Currently, ACE \\r\\ninhibitors are considered the fi rst-line agents in the treat-\\r\\nment of heart failure and have been shown to have a benefi -\\r\\ncial eff ect on cardiac remodeling. 29. Th  e answer is E (I, II, and III). Digoxin is excreted by \\r\\nthe renal route, with 60% to 80% of bioavailable digoxin ex-\\r\\ncreted unchanged by glomerular fi ltration and active tubular \\r\\nsecretion. Th  e half-life for digoxin in patients with normal \\r\\nrenal function is approximately 1.6 days, whereas renal func-\\r\\ntion may signifi cantly increase the elimination half-life.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"32136299-35fb-4e8f-969e-6b233bc1f158":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"32136299-35fb-4e8f-969e-6b233bc1f158\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"KEC1vTGbzqOBfq1nVA/6nJbzLS2wNLK2WUtfB2HY+wA=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"wQ+MntLop0yDd7aVqRwX85CKFvT2C93WRc1jSkQl5kw=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"9cf557bd-03d1-42d7-a4e1-6f71892bfa1c\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"5DDN/+Q34OVcPB0oTdjPtzR4BCAAIHuSgUOIKn6pYOw=\"}},\"hash\":\"XG5oKBfoOS3FC49nmewAiRwkY4wQpsTYqgsCkvkSOA0=\",\"text\":\"In \\r\\ncongestive heart failure patients, renal clearance of digoxin \\r\\nmay be reduced enough to allow for signifi cant accumulation \\r\\nof drug if dose is not altered.

Potassium \\r\\nlevels need to be evaluated prior to initiating therapy. 30. Th  e answer is A. Hydralazine (Apresoline) is an arte-\\r\\nriole dilator that has been used in hypertension. However, \\r\\nby decreasing peripheral vascular resistance, it also has been \\r\\nshown to reduce aft erload in patients with heart failure. A Veterans Administration study has shown that the com-\\r\\nbination of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate signifi cantly \\r\\nreduced mortality in heart failure patients unresponsive to \\r\\ndigitalis and diuretics. Long-term therapy with hydralazine \\r\\nhas been associated with the development of systemic lupus \\r\\nerythematosus, which presents as fatigue, malaise, low-grade \\r\\nfever, and joint aches and pains. Baseline and serial blood \\r\\ncounts for antinuclear antibody titers should be performed; \\r\\nif systemic lupus erythematosus develops, discontinuation of \\r\\nthe drug results in reversal of the symptoms over time. 31. Th  e answer is E (I, II, and III). Inamrinone, dobuta-\\r\\nmine, and dopamine are inotropic agents. Inotropic agents \\r\\nhave been used in the emergency treatment of patients with \\r\\nheart failure and in patients refractory to, or unable to take, \\r\\ndigitalis. However, current guidelines provide a Class III rec-\\r\\nommendation for these drugs. In addition, current guide-\\r\\nlines provide a Class IIb recommendation—“conditions for \\r\\nwhich there is confl icting evidence and/or a divergence of \\r\\nopinion about the usefulness/effi  cacy of performing the pro-\\r\\ncedure/therapy and that the usefulness/effi  cacy is less well \\r\\nestablished by evidence/ opinion”—for the use of continuous \\r\\n intravenous infusion of a positive inotropic agent for pallia-\\r\\ntion of heart failure symptoms. 32.

Th e answer is C. Four clinical classes have been \\r\\n described for diabetes mellitus and include type 1, type \\r\\n2, gestational diabetes mellitus, and secondary diabetes. However, the three major classes include type 1, type 2, \\r\\nand gestational. Hyperglycemia is elevated blood sugar but \\r\\nis not identifi ed as a clinical class of diabetes mellitus. Hy-\\r\\nperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) can occur in type 2 \\r\\ndiabetes, when blood glucose levels increase but without the \\r\\nbreakdown of fats because some insulin is present. Diabetic \\r\\n ketoacidosis may occur in patients with type 1 diabetes. Th is \\r\\nresults in hyperglycemia and the breakdown of fats because \\r\\nof insulin insuffi  ciency. Ketonemia (accumulation of ketone \\r\\nbodies in the blood) results from the breakdown of adipose \\r\\ntissue when there is insulin defi ciency in type 1 diabetes. Th  iazide diuretics and Cushing syndrome may result in hy-\\r\\nperglycemia (secondary diabetes). Th  ere is no such thing as \\r\\ntype 3 diabetes. 44. Th  e answer is C (I and II). Choices I and II describe \\r\\nthe diagnostic criteria for nonpregnant adults. As document-\\r\\ned by the pharmacist in the notes section, the patient had a \\r\\n hemoglobin  A1C \\u000f 6.5% at 7.3%, and a random blood glu-\\r\\ncose level \\u000f 126 mg/dL at 140 mg/dL. Additional diagnostic \\r\\n criteria would include a plasma glucose level 2 hours aft er \\r\\na glucose load (postprandial) \\u000f 200 mg/dL. Mr. Farmer’s \\r\\n postprandial glucose level was 175 mg/dL. 45. Th  e answer is E (I, II, and III). Hemoglobin A1C is a \\r\\nuseful long-term monitoring tool to measure glycemic con-\\r\\ntrol. It is usually tested at least once or twice per year in pa-\\r\\ntients under good control and at least quarterly for therapy \\r\\nchanges and for those who are in poor control. Th e value \\r\\nof \\b 7% (based on 6.5% as the upper limit of normal) is a \\r\\ndesired therapeutic endpoint per the American Diabetes \\r\\n Association standards of medical care. 46. Th   e answer is E (I, II, and III). Glyburide is chemically \\r\\nclassifi  ed as a sulfonylurea. Th   ese agents stimulate the pancre-\\r\\natic secretion of insulin (insulin secretagogue) and,  therefore, \\r\\n result in lowered blood glucose (hypoglycemic agent) levels. 47. Th e answer is B (III). Celecoxib is classifi ed as an \\r\\nNSAID, which was added by Dr. Wilson to help Mr. Farmer \\r\\nwith his osteoarthritis. However, the patient has a history of \\r\\nis given as an IV infusion of 5 to 10 \\u0007g/kg/min. Timolol and \\r\\natenolol are \\u0004-adrenergic blockers, verapamil is a calcium-\\r\\nchannel blocker, and disopyramide is a class IA antiarrhythmic \\r\\nagent—all have negative inotropic activities. Th  eir use could \\r\\ncreate a problem in a patient who requires inotropic support. \\u0004-Adrenergic blockers are currently recommended as fi rst-line \\r\\nagents in patients with stable heart failure, unless they have a \\r\\ncontraindication to their use or cannot tolerate their eff ects be-\\r\\ncause of hypotension, bradycardia, bronchospasm, and the like. 37.

Lansoprazole (Prevacid) is a PPI \\r\\nused for the short-term treatment of refractory duode-\\r\\nnal ulcer, severe erosive esophagitis, and poorly respon-\\r\\nsive  gastroesophageal refl ux disease. Cimetidine (Tagamet) \\r\\nand famotidine (Pepcid) are H2-receptor antagonists that \\r\\nwork by inhibiting the actions of histamine at the parietal \\r\\ncell receptor sites. Sucralfate (Carafate) is a nonabsorbable \\r\\nmucosal protectant that adheres to the base of ulcer craters. Octreotide (Sandostatin) is a long-acting synthetic octapep-\\r\\ntide that works like somatostatin by inhibiting serotonin, \\r\\ngastrin, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, insulin, glucagon, \\r\\ngrowth hormone, and other agents. 38. Th  e answer is A. Creatinine is formed during muscle \\r\\nmetabolism, and creatinine clearance is the most common \\r\\nmethod for the measurement of GFR. When only the serum \\r\\ncreatinine level and the patient’s age, weight, and gender \\r\\nare known, creatinine clearance may be determined by the \\r\\nCockcroft  and Gault equation. 39. Th  e answer is E (I, II, and III). Low doses of aspirin \\r\\nand other salicylates inhibit the tubular secretion of uric \\r\\nacid, which may result in uric acid accumulation and gout. Nicotinic acid competes with uric acid for excretion in the \\r\\nkidney tubule, resulting in greater retention of uric acid and \\r\\nthe possibility of a gout attack. Cytotoxic drugs, by nature of \\r\\ntheir ability to increase nucleic acid turnover (uric acid is a \\r\\nby product of nucleic acid), cause an increase in uric acid and \\r\\nthe potential for a gout attack. 40.

Sulfonylureas are not associated \\r\\nwith weight loss, but instead have shown to cause weight \\r\\ngain, which is one of the most undesirable side eff ects \\r\\n associated with sulfonylureas. Hypoglycemia is probably the \\r\\nmost troublesome of side eff ects and can represent a medical \\r\\nemergency. Sulfonylureas were the fi  rst orally available agents \\r\\nintroduced in the late 1950s for the treatment of type 2 diabe-\\r\\ntes and an alternative to the routine use of injectable insulin. 54. Th  e answer is B. In late 2010, the FDA arrived at the \\r\\nconclusion that rosiglitazone had demonstrated an increased \\r\\nrisk of MI in diabetic patients taking the drug. Th is resulted \\r\\nin a decision during late 2010 to restrict the availability of \\r\\nrosiglitazone to patients who are already taking the drug \\r\\naft er being advised of the increased risk, or those who are \\r\\nunable to take alternative drugs in the treatment of type 2 \\r\\ndiabetes mellitus. Celecoxib has been given a Black Box \\r\\nWarning as well for an increased risk of serious cardiovas-\\r\\ncular events, MI, and stroke, but has not yet been restricted, \\r\\nas rosiglitazone. 55. Th   e answer is E (I, II, and III). Exenatide (Byetta) acti-\\r\\nvates glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor, resulting in \\r\\nthe increase in insulin secretion, while decreasing glucagon \\r\\nsecretion and delaying gastric emptying. Exenatide is a syn-\\r\\nthetic version of the hormone substance, exendin-4, which is \\r\\nfound in the saliva of the Gila monster.

Before recommending an \\r\\nOTC product for the treatment of the common cold, it is im-\\r\\nportant to know what symptoms the patient is experiencing \\r\\nand then target the therapy to those symptoms—most likely \\r\\nwith a single-ingredient product. Phenylephrine administra-\\r\\ntion may result in increasing Mr. Farmer’s blood sugar, so \\r\\nthis agent should be used cautiously (if at all) in patients \\r\\nwith diabetes. Additionally, the product does contain 325 mg \\r\\npeptic ulcer disease, and the use of an NSAID in this patient \\r\\npopulation should be avoided. Ramipril is an ACE inhibi-\\r\\ntor, which would be a rational initial choice in the treatment \\r\\nof the patient’s hypertension with diabetes as a comorbidity. Metformin is considered within several national guidelines \\r\\nas the initial therapy. Key benefi ts include consistent lower-\\r\\ning of blood glucose levels, lack of substantial weight gain \\r\\nassociated with its use, low cost, and a high level of patient \\r\\nacceptance. 48.

Current terminology has not included angina pectoris \\r\\nas one of the acute coronary syndromes. 66. Th e answer is D. Th eophylline serum levels are in-\\r\\ncreased by conditions that decrease theophylline elimination. Smoking increases the rate of theophylline elimination by in-\\r\\ncreasing the rate of metabolism, resulting in a reduced serum \\r\\ntheophylline level. Pneumonia, ciprofl oxacin, cor  pulmonale, \\r\\nand heart failure decrease the rate of theophylline elimina-\\r\\ntion, resulting in an increased serum theophylline level. 67. Th   e answer is B (III). Atenolol is a \\u0004-adrenergic block-\\r\\ning agent, which is a relatively cardioselective agent. Even \\r\\nthough this agent is \\u0004-1 selective and would be a preferred \\r\\n\\u0004-blocker over a nonselective agent (such as  propranolol), \\r\\nit should be used cautiously at higher doses because of in-\\r\\ncreased risk of acute bronchospasm.

Irbesartan is a member of a large class \\r\\nof agents referred to as angiotensin II receptor antagonists, \\r\\nwhich decrease the conversion of angiotensin I to angioten-\\r\\nsin II. Th  is results in a reduction in the release of aldosterone \\r\\nas well as a reduction in the powerful vasoconstrictor eff ects \\r\\nof angiotensin II. 70. Th  e answer is D.

Caution is needed when introduc-\\r\\ning anticholinergics in this patient who has narrow-angle \\r\\nglaucoma. Anticholinergic agents may aggravate certain \\r\\nother underlying conditions and, therefore, should also be \\r\\nused with caution in patients with obstructions of the GI or \\r\\ngenitourinary tracts or severe cardiac disease. Side eff ects \\r\\nusually include dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, uri-\\r\\nnary  retention, and tachycardia. Central nervous system side \\r\\n eff ects may include hallucinations, ataxia, mental slowing, \\r\\nconfusion, and memory impairment. 77. Th  e answer is E (I, II, and III). Levodopa is capable of \\r\\ncausing adverse drug reactions within the GI, cardiovascu-\\r\\nlar, and musculoskeletal systems. Additional organ systems \\r\\nwith associated adverse reactions include the central nervous \\r\\nsystem (confusion, memory changes, depression, hallucina-\\r\\ntions, and psychosis) and the hematologic system (hemolytic \\r\\nanemia, leukopenia, and agranulocytosis). 78. Th  e answer is B (III). Anticholinergic agents should \\r\\nbe given one drug at a time. Several agents are available for \\r\\ntherapy, and they all appear to be equally eff ective. One of \\r\\nthe principles of drug therapy is that if a patient does not \\r\\nrespond to an agent in one class, try another class. Th e \\r\\n exception  includes the use of dopamine agonists, such as \\r\\nbromocriptine; patients who do not respond to one of the \\r\\nagents may not respond to another. 79. Th  e answer is D. Of the drugs listed, only amantadine \\r\\nhas dopaminergic properties. Although the full extent of its \\r\\nmechanism of action is not known, amantadine stimulates \\r\\nthe presynaptic release of dopamine and has demonstrated \\r\\nbenefi t in Parkinson disease. Available dopaminergic agents \\r\\nand their mechanisms include levodopa, which exogenously \\r\\nreplenishes striatal dopamine; bromocriptine, which directly \\r\\nstimulates dopamine receptors; selegiline and rasagiline, \\r\\nwhich selectively inhibits monoamine oxidase type B and \\r\\n selectively prevents the breakdown of dopamine in the brain; \\r\\npramipexole and ropinirole, which are considered nonergot \\r\\ndopamine agents; rotigotine, which stimulates dopamine re-\\r\\nceptors; and tolcapone and entacapone, referred to as COMT \\r\\ninhibitors, which delay the breakdown of dopamine in the \\r\\nbrain. Pergolide, another dopaminergic agent, was recently \\r\\nremoved from the U.S. market. 80. Th e answer is A. Levodopa must be converted to \\r\\ndopamine, and this conversion must occur centrally, for \\r\\ntherapeutic eff ect. Because dopamine does not  readily \\r\\ncross the blood–brain barrier, it is important that only \\r\\nminimal amounts of levodopa be converted to dopamine \\r\\n peripherally. Th e enzyme for this metabolic reaction is \\r\\n71. Th  e answer is A. According to the recommendations \\r\\nof the JNC-7 (a multidisciplinary, national collaborative \\r\\ngroup), drug therapy is usually initiated with a thiazide \\r\\n diuretic in patients with stage I hypertension not associ-\\r\\nated with any of the compelling indications. However, ad-\\r\\nditional recommendations include alternative therapy with \\r\\nACE  inhibitors, ARBs, \\u0004-adrenergic receptor blockers, or \\r\\n calcium-channel blockers for patients who are unable to \\r\\ntolerate a thiazide diuretic or who do not respond appro-\\r\\npriately to them. Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing \\r\\ndiuretic that antagonizes aldosterone receptors within the \\r\\ndistal convoluted tubule and has minor diuretic eff ects. Doxazosin is a peripherally acting \\u0005-adrenergic blocker \\r\\nthat demonstrated potentially negative clinical eff ects in the \\r\\nAntihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent \\r\\nHeart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) study.

In most patients, the \\r\\ncause of Parkinson disease is unknown (idiopathic); however, \\r\\na small percentage of cases are secondary, and many of these \\r\\ncases are curable. Secondary parkinsonism may be caused \\r\\nby drugs such as dopamine antagonists (phenothiazine, bu-\\r\\ntyrophenones such as haloperidol, reserpine), poisoning by \\r\\nchemicals such as carbon monoxide and heavy metals (such \\r\\nas manganese and mercury), infectious  diseases such as viral \\r\\nencephalitis and syphilis, and other causes  (arteriosclerosis, \\r\\ndegenerative diseases of the central nervous system, and \\r\\n various metabolic disorders). 73. Th  e answer is B (III). Diphenhydramine is an antihis-\\r\\ntaminic agent that has some mild anticholinergic eff ects and \\r\\nis used for symptomatic relief of mild tremor. Amantadine \\r\\nis a dopaminergic agent. Trihexyphenidyl is an anticholin-\\r\\nergic agent.

Owing to its adverse reaction within \\r\\nthe central nervous system, diphenhydramine should be \\r\\nused with caution in the elderly. 74. Th  e answer is C. Trihexyphenidyl is an anticholinergic \\r\\nagent used in the treatment of Parkinson disease; the daily \\r\\ndo sage range is 6 to 10 mg orally.

Th  e answer is A. Th e Cockcroft  and Gault equation \\r\\nis a common method for estimating creatinine clearance. Th  is equation is based on the serum creatinine concentra-\\r\\ntion and patient characteristics, including age, weight, and \\r\\ngender. Fick’s law describes drug diff usion by passive trans-\\r\\nport from a region of high drug concentration to a region \\r\\nof lower drug concentration.

Exogenous pyridoxine can, therefore, increase \\r\\nthe peripheral metabolism of levodopa, making less dopa-\\r\\nmine available centrally for the desired eff ect. 81. Th  e answer is A (I). Carbidopa inhibits the peripheral \\r\\ndecarboxylation of levodopa to dopamine. Carbidopa does \\r\\nnot cross the blood–brain barrier, therefore making more \\r\\nlevodopa available for transport to the brain.

Postrenal ARF occurs because \\r\\nof obstruction of urine fl ow along the urinary tract as a \\r\\n result of uric acid crystals, thrombi, bladder obstruction, etc. Mr. Rones has a history of heart failure and hypertension, \\r\\nwhich are both capable of causing ARF. Hyperkalemia does \\r\\nnot cause ARF, but rather ARF is associated with hyperkale-\\r\\nmia, which might be considered a medical emergency. 97. Th  e answer is E. Mr. Rones has reported allergies to \\r\\nsulfonamides and penicillin, so he should not be given any \\r\\nof the medications. Penicillin V potassium (V-Cillin-K) is \\r\\na penicillin. Although the pharmacist may not know the \\r\\n exact nature of the reported allergy, a conversation with the \\r\\nphysician would answer the question of whether an allergy \\r\\n exists. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim, Septra) \\r\\nand hydrochlorothiazide are both sulfonamide derivatives; \\r\\nagain, the pharmacist may not know the exact nature of \\r\\nthe  reported allergy, but a follow-up conversation with the \\r\\n physician should take place before fi lling either of these \\r\\n prescriptions for the patient. 98. Th  e answer is E (I, II, and III). Slow-K is a potassium \\r\\nsupplement used to prevent hypokalemia. However, Mr. Rones is diagnosed as having hyperkalemia, probably sec-\\r\\nondary to ARF, and he should not receive the prescription. In  addition, moexipril, an ACE inhibitor, is contraindicated \\r\\nin hyperkalemia owing to its potassium-retaining properties. Sudafed (pseudoephedrine HCl) is an indirect-acting sym-\\r\\npathomimetic that stimulates receptors, resulting in the re-\\r\\nlease of adrenergic amines; it must be used with great caution \\r\\nin this hypertensive patient. Th  e pharmacist should contact \\r\\nthe physician before dispensing either of these prescriptions \\r\\nto determine whether the physician does indeed want to use \\r\\nthem. 99. Th  e answer is A (I). Mr. Rones has heart failure as a \\r\\ncompelling indication, which would suggest the use of \\r\\n diuretics, ACE inhibitors (ramipril), ARBs (candesartan), \\r\\n \\u0004-adrenergic blockers (atenolol), or an aldosterone an-\\r\\ntagonist such as spironolactone. However, because of the \\r\\n presence of hyperkalemia in this patient, ramipril and can-\\r\\ndesartan should be avoided if possible. 100. Th   e answer is C. Situations that favor the development \\r\\nof hypokalemia—use of non–potassium-sparing diuretics, \\r\\nfailure to administer potassium supplements, administration \\r\\nof agents that decrease serum potassium (Kayexalate, so-\\r\\ndium polystyrene sulfonate)—have been reported to be able \\r\\nto cause digoxin toxicity because of the development of hy-\\r\\npokalemia. Phenytoin and lidocaine have both been shown \\r\\nto be eff ective in the treatment of digoxin toxicity–induced \\r\\narrhythmias. Digoxin is primarily eliminated in the active \\r\\nform via the kidney, but when renal function decreases, as \\r\\nin advancing age, the elimination of the drug is decreased. 91.

Digoxin does pos-\\r\\nsess two pharmacologic eff ects that refl ect its concentration \\r\\nwithin the body. With lower total body stores (8 to 12 mg/\\r\\nkg), digoxin exerts a positive inotropic eff ect on the myo-\\r\\ncardium: an increase in cardiac output and renal blood fl ow \\r\\nand a decrease in cardiac fi lling pressure, venous and cap-\\r\\nillary pressures, heart size, and fl uid volume. With higher \\r\\ntotal body stores (15 to 18  mg/kg), digoxin produces nega-\\r\\ntive chronotropic eff ects—a reduction in electrical impulse \\r\\nconduction from the sinoatrial node throughout the atria \\r\\ninto the atrioventricular node. 106. Th   e answer is E. It takes four to fi ve half-lives, with no \\r\\nloading doses given, for a patient to reach steady-state serum \\r\\ndigoxin concentrations. For an anephric patient, who has a \\r\\nterminal half-life of 3.5 to 4.5 days, 15 to 20 days would be \\r\\nrequired to reach a steady state. If the patient is in acute heart \\r\\nfailure, the treatment of choice is rapid loading of enough \\r\\ndigoxin to obtain total body stores of 8 to 12 mg/kg over a \\r\\n12-hour period, followed by daily maintenance doses. Th e \\r\\npatient who has normal renal function needs 6 to 8 days \\r\\nof daily maintenance doses to reach steady state, if loading \\r\\n doses are not given. 107. Th  e answer is E. Acebutolol (Sectral) is a long-acting, \\r\\nrelatively cardioselective agent that may be benefi cial in pa-\\r\\ntients who have lung disease and need to receive fewer doses \\r\\nper day to increase compliance. All \\u0004-adrenergic blockers \\r\\nhave the potential to cause bronchospasm in patients with \\r\\nsuspected lung disease, but the cardioselective agents may \\r\\nprovide benefi t in lower doses. Carvedilol (Coreg) lacks car-\\r\\ndioselectivity and is available as an extended-release product. Esmolol (Brevibloc) is available only in intravenous form \\r\\nand has a very short half-life of approximately 9 minutes. Nadolol (Corgard) is a long-acting agent without cardiose-\\r\\nlective properties. Propranolol (Inderal LA) would off er no \\r\\nmore cardioselective properties than those of Inderal. 108. Th  e answer is A (I). Isosorbide dinitrate (Isordil) and \\r\\nother nitrates have been shown to reduce pulmonary con-\\r\\ngestion and increase cardiac output by reducing preload \\r\\nand perhaps aft erload. Nitrates generally cause venous dila-\\r\\ntion, with a resultant increase in venous pooling and a re-\\r\\nduction in venous return and preload. Th  e combination of \\r\\nnitrates with hydralazine (arteriole dilator) has been shown \\r\\nto reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with heart fail-\\r\\nure. However, the combination should not be used as ini-\\r\\ntial  therapy over ACE inhibitors but should be considered \\r\\nin patients who are intolerant of ACE inhibitors. Dopamine \\r\\nand dobutamine are inotropic agents, and current guidelines \\r\\nprovide a Class III recommendation (“conditions for which \\r\\nthere is evidence and/or general agreement that a proce-\\r\\ndure/therapy is not useful/eff ective and in some cases may \\r\\nbe harmful”).

Delavirdine, \\r\\nefavirenz, and  nevirapine are examples of nonnucleoside \\r\\nreverse transcriptase inhibitors and are used in the treat-\\r\\nment of HIV as well. 117. Th  e answer is A (I). Th  e rate of dissolution of a weak \\r\\nacid drug is directly infl uenced by the surface area of the \\r\\n solid particles, the water in oil partition coeffi  cient, and the \\r\\nconcentration gradient between the drug concentrations in \\r\\nthe stagnant layer and the bulk phase of the solvent. An in-\\r\\ncrease in the pH of the medium will make the medium more \\r\\nalkaline, and the weak acid will convert to the ionized spe-\\r\\ncies, becoming more water soluble. Increasing the particle \\r\\nsize decreases the eff ective surface area of the solid drug. Increasing the viscosity of the medium slows the diff usion of \\r\\ndrug molecules into the solvent. 118.

Lithium therapy is \\r\\n monitored   eff ectively by periodic determinations of serum \\r\\n lithium levels.

A variety of \\r\\nfactors can aff ect serum lithium levels; important among \\r\\nthese are the time between the last dose and the taking of \\r\\nthe blood sample and the concomitant drug therapy (e.g., \\r\\nthiazide  diuretics may increase serum lithium levels; extra \\r\\nsodium in the diet may decrease lithium levels [note the salt-\\r\\nrestricted diet in order]). If the patient were acutely manic \\r\\non admission, it might indicate that he was not taking his \\r\\nlithium medication as prescribed. Patients presenting with \\r\\nacute mania generally require levels in the higher end of the \\r\\ntherapeutic range. 122. Th  e answer is A (I).

Th  e lithium level, \\r\\nwhich was ordered on admission returned at 0.9 mEq/L \\r\\nand the physician opted to add a second agent rather than \\r\\n reevaluate the lithium level from admission.

Base-\\r\\nline laboratory tests for olanzapine include blood glucose, a \\r\\nlipid profi le, height and weight, and EKG for those with car-\\r\\ndiovascular risk factors. 124. Th  e answer is D. Lithium is eliminated renally by \\r\\nglomerular fi ltration and competes with sodium for reab-\\r\\nsorption in the renal tubules. Th  iazide diuretics interfere \\r\\nwith sodium reabsorption and, therefore, may favor lithium \\r\\n reabsorption, leading to elevated lithium levels.

Hydroxychloroquine is given in dosages of 400 to 600 mg/day \\r\\nand has been associated with severe and sometimes  irreversible \\r\\nadverse eff ects on the eyes, skin, central nervous system, and \\r\\nbone marrow.

Th  e answer is A. Clopidogrel bisulfate (Plavix) is an \\r\\nantiplatelet drug indicated for the reduction of atheroscle-\\r\\nrotic events (MI, stroke, and vascular death) in patients with \\r\\natherosclerosis documented by recent stroke, recent MI, or \\r\\nestablished peripheral arterial disease.

Like hydroxy-\\r\\nchloroquine (Plaquenil), they are added to fi rst-line therapy \\r\\nto slow or delay progression of the disabling symptoms and \\r\\neff ects of rheumatoid arthritis. 142. Th  e answer is E (I, II, and III). Celecoxib (Celebrex) \\r\\nrepresents a class of NSAIDs referred to as cyclooxygen-\\r\\nase 2 (COX-2) receptor inhibitors. It is believed to off er  a \\r\\npotential  benefi t over traditional NSAIDs by reducing the \\r\\ngastrointestinal consequences associated with use of these \\r\\nagents. Naproxen (Naprosyn) is an NSAID that is also used \\r\\nin the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Nabumetone, an-\\r\\nother NSAID agent, is believed to have a greater specifi city \\r\\nfor the COX-2 receptor than the COX-1 receptor; it has also \\r\\nbeen used in the symptomatic control of rheumatoid arthri-\\r\\ntis.

Th  e other four agents are all considered safe and \\r\\neff ective for treating tinea pedis. 152. Th e answer is A. Diphenhydramine and dox-\\r\\nylamine are two ethanolamine antihistamines, gener-\\r\\nally considered the most sedating class of antihistamines. Brompheniramine,    chlorpheniramine,    dexbromphenira-\\r\\nmine, and  pheniramine are part of the alkylamine class of \\r\\nantihistamines, which are among the least sedating of the \\r\\nfi rst-generation anti histamines.

Loratadine is a second-genera-\\r\\ntion nonsedating  antihistamine that recently was moved to \\r\\nOTC status. 153. Th  e answer is B. Th  e second-generation nonsedating \\r\\nantihistamine, loratadine (e.g., Claritin), is available OTC. Th is patient’s specifi c symptoms are related to histamine \\r\\n eff ects, so an antihistamine is warranted. Given his occu-\\r\\npation, the pharmacist would not want to give this patient \\r\\na sedating antihistamine, such as diphenhydramine. Even \\r\\nthough loratadine is considered a nonsedating antihista-\\r\\nmine, a small percentage of patients experience somnolence \\r\\n(8%) and fatigue (4%). Mr. Conway should certainly see how \\r\\nthis agent aff ects him before he attempts to drive. He does \\r\\nnot have nasal congestion, so the decongestant (pseudo-\\r\\nephedrine) is not warranted at this time. 154. Th  e answer is A. Nonsalicylate NSAIDs (ibuprofen, \\r\\nnaproxen) are the most eff ective OTC agents for primary \\r\\ndysmenorrhea. Aspirin and acetaminophen are generally \\r\\nless eff ective. Ketoprofen had been available, previously \\r\\nwithout a prescription, however, now does requires one so \\r\\nyou would need to contact her physician in order to obtain \\r\\nsuch a  prescription. Ketoprofen is the correct answer here \\r\\nbecause it should be used only in patients 16 years of age \\r\\nand older. 155. Th  e answer is C (I and II). Pyrethrins with piperonyl \\r\\n butoxide (synergized pyrethrins) and permethrin are the two \\r\\nsafe and eff ective OTC agents used to treat head lice. Patients \\r\\nshould be warned to use these as directed because there is a \\r\\ngrowing trend of lice resistance to these products. Lindane \\r\\nis available only by prescription and has generally fallen into \\r\\ndisfavor. 156. Th  e answer is C.

Th  e elevated BUN and \\r\\nSCr would likely indicate that she has some renal impair-\\r\\nwith NSAIDs. Th  e lowest eff ective dose should be used to \\r\\nminimize adverse eff ects. 145. Th  e answer is B. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis \\r\\noft en have a normocytic, normochromic anemia, oft en re-\\r\\nferred to as an anemia of chronic disease. In fact, anemia \\r\\nhas been reported to occur in as many as 60% of all rheu-\\r\\nmatoid arthritis, only surpassed in occurrence by joint \\r\\nsymptoms. Th  is anemia does not respond to drug therapy \\r\\n(i.e., iron  therapy). Sometimes, this may produce a diagnos-\\r\\ntic dilemma because patients on NSAIDs may develop gas-\\r\\ntric irritation with chronic blood loss, which would lead to \\r\\niron defi ciency anemia. Other blood tests can help diff eren-\\r\\ntiate these two types of anemia—for example, serum iron to \\r\\niron binding capacity and mean corpuscular volume (usually \\r\\ndecreased in iron defi ciency). 146.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"b5ab5c99-9367-4e0f-9016-4d68d7eab447":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"b5ab5c99-9367-4e0f-9016-4d68d7eab447\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"mISlyJwqj9qnYCmW1b2mR/nzTuhzHM5A9QtwWNW8jrU=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"AH5H8/w0co/1qNzuu8qh/i9/f9NuXbDjnFsx1/GhkT4=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"a7a40417-e10a-4a73-b3af-a7d3428cfa0c\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"kxKcX/9SNws10xmopbP8iR9CDZ5duQbc9FvU507cWns=\"}},\"hash\":\"QZgBwMZeNHFVvnHztefzy3NHtVc2RW6yvhukz2jiVKE=\",\"text\":\"146.

Th  e answer is B. Th  e following are signifi cant major \\r\\nadverse eff ects of amiodarone: pulmonary toxicity (which \\r\\nmay present as pulmonary fi  brosis), hypothyroidism,  corneal \\r\\n microdeposits, and hepatotoxicity. Hypotension is a major \\r\\nconcern, not  hypertension. 165. Th  e answer is B. Morphine sulfate is a narcotic anal-\\r\\ngesic with venous pooling properties that reduces preload. Preload reduction decreases the oxygen demand placed on \\r\\nthe heart. For this reason, along with its ability to alleviate \\r\\npain and reduce anxiety (anxiety and pain also increase oxy-\\r\\ngen demand), morphine is frequently used in the myocardial \\r\\ninfarction patient. 166. Th  e answer is C. NicoDerm CQ patch contains nico-\\r\\ntine (not nitroglycerin) and has been shown to be eff ective \\r\\nin helping patients stop smoking. Nitroglycerin patches are \\r\\navailable in several brands (e.g., Nitro-Dur). All of the other \\r\\ngeneric names match with a trade name. 167. Th  e answer is C (I and II). Isosorbide dinitrate (Is-\\r\\nordil) is used in both angina pectoris and heart failure. Th e \\r\\ndevelopment of angina pectoris centers around the balance \\r\\nbetween oxygen demand and oxygen supply to the myo-\\r\\ncardium. When the demand for oxygen exceeds the supply \\r\\nof oxygen, an angina attack occurs. Isosorbide dinitrate, \\r\\nlike other nitrates, is a venous dilator resulting in reduced \\r\\noxygen demand by the heart through a decrease in (ve-\\r\\nnous return) preload. Isosorbide works in the heart failure \\r\\npatient by reducing venous return of blood to the heart, \\r\\ntherefore, again, decreasing preload with a resultant de-\\r\\ncrease in fl uid for the heart to pump. Clinical studies have \\r\\ndemonstrated that the combination of isosorbide dinitrate \\r\\nwith the arteriole dilator hydralazine has reduced mortal-\\r\\nity and morbidity in heart failure patients. Heart failure is a \\r\\npotential consequence of an acute MI, and angina pectoris \\r\\nis a common underlying problem in many patients who \\r\\nhave had an MI. 168. Th  e answer is A. Reteplase (Retavase) is a throm-\\r\\nbolytic and has been shown to be eff ective during the fi rst \\r\\nseveral hours aft er a STEMI. However, for an NSTEMI \\r\\nthere is no evidence to support the use of a thrombolytic. Metoprolol, like other \\u0004-adrenergic blockers administered \\r\\nshortly aft er an acute MI, has been shown to be eff ective \\r\\nin reducing mortality and morbidity. Aspirin in the dose \\r\\nof 162 to 325 mg should be given as soon as possible aft er \\r\\nthe event. Patients with ongoing NSTEMI or ischemic dis-\\r\\ncomfort should  receive sublingual nitroglycerin. Morphine \\r\\nis used to treat myocardial pain and discomfort and causes \\r\\nvenous pooling, reduces preload, cardiac workload, and \\r\\noxygen consumption. 169. Th  e answer is B. Sudafed (Pseudoephedrine), a sym-\\r\\npathomimetic amine, has central nervous system (CNS) \\r\\nment. Th  e WBC count is elevated and could be caused by \\r\\nthe  presence of a bacterial infection. Th  e presence of nitrites \\r\\nin the urine most commonly indicates the presence of gram-\\r\\nnegative bacteria. Since Ms. Urmeister’s urinalysis did not \\r\\nreveal any nitrites, the likely bacterial cause of her suspected \\r\\nUTI is a gram-positive pathogen such as Enterococcus. Based \\r\\non the presence of leukocytes and leukocyte esterase in her \\r\\nurinalysis, her WBC count, and her symptoms one can con-\\r\\nfi rm the diagnosis of a UTI. 158. The answer is C. Amoxicillin would be the most \\r\\n appropriate therapy choice for the treatment of the UTI \\r\\nbased on the patient’s current medication regimen, renal \\r\\nfunction, and likely causative organism. Sulfamethoxa-\\r\\nzole/trimethoprim would not be the best option due to \\r\\nthe  major interaction with her concomitant warfarin \\r\\n (Coumadin) therapy (increases INR, increases risk of \\r\\nbleeding).\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"10ae12fb-ed85-4072-90da-9e25bcf8fcec":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"10ae12fb-ed85-4072-90da-9e25bcf8fcec\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"jeb+ftmyh9NPgVAY4vlXbyhwbpC3jq8jSG9FVD4WqLE=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"Of9tmcNdMTIdKxdqZsrDgtVxRGGWXdDe8VYoEM4B12s=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"f9b88ee3-e795-43bb-b4bb-bc1c76c128b4\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"cSvKL7GebekPAv9CjgpRJRXAOh6SyTO3GrPKf5SnQWY=\"}},\"hash\":\"VwZ0j0nmYioIaFCGSatEdPJFUxY6s05bh4XXUbA5fS4=\",\"text\":\"Nitrofurantoin would not be the best option \\r\\ndue to the patient’s renal function and CrCl of \\b 60 mL/\\r\\nmin, at which point its use is contraindicated.

Warfarin has two main mecha-\\r\\nnisms of action. It works to inhibit the production of the \\r\\nvitamin K–dependent clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X \\r\\nand the  production of the anticoagulant proteins C and S. Heparin produces its anticoagulant eff ect by increasing the \\r\\nactivity of antithrombin III. Dabigatran is a direct throm-\\r\\nbin  inhibitor. 160. Th  e answer is A. Routine monitoring parameters for \\r\\nwarfarin include prothrombin time, INR, hematocrit, and \\r\\nstool guaiac.

Th  e answer is C. If topical nasal decongestants are \\r\\nused for more oft en than 3 to 5 days, rhinitis medicamen-\\r\\ntosa (rebound congestion) may occur in the nasal passages. Th  us, the patient ends up experiencing as a side eff ect what \\r\\nhe sought to treat in the fi rst place.

Coreg CR is an extend-\\r\\ned-release form of carvedilol, a \\u0004-adrenergic blocking agent. Many of the currently available extended-release dosage \\r\\nforms cannot be cut or crushed because that would disrupt \\r\\nthe integrity of the delivery system and would have the po-\\r\\ntential to provide active drug for more rapid absorption, thus \\r\\ncausing toxicity. 179.

Th   e answer is A. Calcium is available for oral admin-\\r\\nistration in a salt form of lactate, gluconate, phosphate, and \\r\\ncarbonate; it is not available for oral administration in a salt \\r\\nform of chloride. Dosage regimens should be individual-\\r\\nized because of diff erences in calcium content of the vari-\\r\\nous salts. 182. Th e answer is C. Osteoporosis, hyperglycemia, \\r\\n fl uid retention, and cataracts are long-term complications \\r\\nof  therapy with steroids, including prednisone. Steroids \\r\\n generally increase the white blood cell count, therefore, leu-\\r\\nkopenia is incorrect. 183. Th  e answer is C. Cidofovir (Vistide) is an antiviral \\r\\nagent used to treat cytomegalovirus replication by selective \\r\\ninhibition of DNA synthesis. It is not a protease inhibitor and \\r\\nis not indicated for treatment of HIV infection. Saquinavir \\r\\n(Invirase), ritonavir (Norvir), atazanavir (Reyataz), and in-\\r\\ndinavir (Crixivan) are protease inhibitors used to treat HIV \\r\\ninfection. 184. Th  e answer is A (I). A pyrogen test is a fever test \\r\\nin rabbits or an in vitro test using the limulus (horseshoe \\r\\ncrab).

Metamucil (psyllium) as a bulk laxative is \\r\\nnot absorbed. Flonase (fl uticasone) would be very unlikely. Benadryl (diphenhydramine) is one of the OTC agents used \\r\\nto treat insomnia and would more likely cause drowsiness. CNS stimulation from regular doses of aspirin is highly \\r\\n unlikely. 170.

Results of the theophylline level on 3/1 indicate a \\r\\n serum level of 14.0 \\tg/mL. Without any change in the \\r\\ntheophylline infusion and without any interruption in \\r\\ntherapy, the theophylline level on 3/4 was reported as \\r\\n17.5 \\tg/mL. Which statement most likely represents \\r\\nthe reason for this increase? A. Th  e blood drawn for the theophylline level was \\r\\nnot timed at steady state. B. Th  e blood taken for the theophylline level was \\r\\ndrawn from the same arm in which theophylline \\r\\nwas infusing. C. Th  e presence of ceft azidime in the blood sample \\r\\ncaused a falsely elevated theophylline level. D. Th  e coadministration of cimetidine competitively \\r\\nblocked the metabolism of theophylline, resulting \\r\\nin a decreased elimination of theophylline. E. Th  e patient had a larger than usual volume of \\r\\ndistribution for theophylline. 144.

Th   e answer is A. All of the symptom pairs listed are pos-\\r\\nsible symptoms of schizophrenia. Th  e most common are hal-\\r\\nlucinations (perception disturbances in sensory experiences \\r\\nof the environment) and delusions (incorrect or false beliefs). 2. Th  e answer is A. Treatment of schizophrenia is primar-\\r\\nily symptomatic. Target symptoms of schizophrenia have \\r\\nbeen categorized as “positive” and “negative” and may be \\r\\nused as a guide in evaluation of therapy. Positive symptoms \\r\\n(e.g., hallucinations, delusions, combativeness, insomnia) \\r\\nas compared to negative symptoms (e.g., poor judgment, \\r\\n apathy, asocial behavior, withdrawal, fl at aff ect). 3. Th  e answer is E. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is \\r\\nan uncommon, but potentially fatal adverse eff ect of anti-\\r\\npsychotics and other drugs which have antidopaminergic \\r\\nactivity; although it has also been associated with drugs void \\r\\nof antidopaminergic activity. Signs and symptoms include \\r\\nfever, rigidity, altered mental status, unstable blood pressure, \\r\\ntachycardia, elevated creatine kinase levels, and an increased \\r\\nwhite blood cell count. Treatment includes supportive care \\r\\nand the use of bromocriptine and/or dantrolene. 4. Th   e answer is C (I and II). Th  e patient is admitted to the \\r\\nhospital in an acute psychotic state, and the decision is made \\r\\nto initiate therapy with haloperidol. Haloperidol is available \\r\\nin several forms; the initial order for haloperidol decanoate \\r\\n50 mg IM represents the treatment of a chronic psychotic \\r\\npatient, which is administered on a monthly basis, once a \\r\\npatient has been stabilized. It is not intended for the acute \\r\\nmanagement of psychosis. Instead, the patient should have \\r\\nreceived an order for haloperidol lactate, where doses of 2 to \\r\\n10 mg IM or IV are given every 4 to 8 hours at the initiation \\r\\nof therapy for acutely agitated patients. 5. Th  e answer is D. An acute dystonic reaction is charac-\\r\\nterized by involuntary tonic contractions of skeletal muscles \\r\\nof virtually any striated muscle group. Th  e greatest period \\r\\nof risk for such a reaction usually is within the fi rst 24 to \\r\\n48 hours of initiating an antipsychotic agent; 95% of dystonic \\r\\nreactions have occurred within 96 hours of antipsychotic ini-\\r\\ntiation or dosage increase. Ms. Curtis is experiencing torticol-\\r\\nlis (muscle spasm of the neck causing the head to be twisted \\r\\nto the side) and oculogyric crisis (a spasm of the eye muscles \\r\\ncausing one or both eyes to become fi xed in an upward gaze). Th  e reaction is treated initially with an  anticholinergic agent \\r\\nsuch as diphenhydramine or  benztropine, given intramus-\\r\\ncularly or intravenously. Relief is usually seen within 15 to \\r\\n20 minutes. Th  e antipsychotic may be continued along with \\r\\na short course of anticholinergic agent. Alternative agents \\r\\n include the benzodiazepines diazepam and lorazepam. 6. Th  e answer is B. Akathisia is a subjective experience of \\r\\nmotor restlessness, and patients usually complain of an in-\\r\\nability to sit still. Th  is adverse symptom occurs in 20% to \\r\\n40% of  patients receiving high-potency fi rst-generation \\r\\nagents (FGAs). Onset of akathisia occurs within the fi rst \\r\\nfew weeks or months of  therapy, and treatment may include \\r\\ndosage reduction, lipophilic \\u0006-blockers, benzodiazepines, or \\r\\n anticholinergic  agents. 7. Th  e answer is E (I, II, and III). All three approaches \\r\\nwould be useful in helping this patient. Given the option \\r\\nof using equally eff ective second-generation antipsychotic \\r\\nagents, with which these reactions are rare, and the previ-\\r\\nously noted reactions that Ms. Curtis has experienced with \\r\\nthe haloperidol, it seems prudent that the best option would \\r\\nbe to discontinue the haloperidol and switch her to a second-\\r\\ngeneration agent. 8. Th e answer is D. Th ioridazine (Mellaril) is a fi rst- \\r\\ngeneration antipsychotic.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"5c02e4f1-0344-4846-889c-6473bc895f46":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"5c02e4f1-0344-4846-889c-6473bc895f46\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"nF3Py0gg0XN4e+QuzSrsgMC2TaAFvp6UO8XEX3AmO/4=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"n+fkXlT1rtC1+VSUg/RMI2e6J0bavnaPQPtVgXJY03A=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"eac6ce05-13ba-423b-ab80-41ca12ed9d91\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"KMaOllJOk5SOPpUfZDo7G0KTFoClOg6DHYe8dlOFeag=\"}},\"hash\":\"Hnn9mXc1kDoHCIdZEuzBQNbwjIKjHqWN9QeInalxRkE=\",\"text\":\"Th e other agents—aripiprazole \\r\\n(Abilify), olanzapine (Zyprexa), ziprasidone (Geodon), and \\r\\nquetiapine (Seroquel)—are all second-generation agents. 9. Th  e answer is E (I, II and III). Haloperidol decanoate \\r\\nis given IM every 3 to 4 weeks. Fluphenazine decanoate is \\r\\n administered every 2 to 3 weeks. Long-acting risperidone \\r\\nis administered IM every 2 weeks and was the fi rst of the \\r\\nsecond-generation agents to be available in this dosage form. 10. Th e answer is C (I and II). With the exception of \\r\\n clozapine, all antipsychotics (FGAs and SGAs) are thought \\r\\nto have similar effi  cacy for positive symptoms. Clozapine has \\r\\ndemonstrated effi  cacy for treatment-refractory schizophrenia. 11. Th   e answer is B. Agranulocytosis, defi ned as a granulo-\\r\\ncyte count \\f 500/mm3, occurs in association with  clozapine \\r\\nuse at a cumulative incidence at 1 year of approximately \\r\\n1.3%. Th  is reaction could prove fatal if it is not detected \\r\\nearly and therapy is not interrupted. Patients should have a \\r\\nwhite blood cell (WBC) count before therapy begins and a \\r\\nclear plan for frequent  (weekly), routine WBC assessment \\r\\nthroughout therapy. 12. Th  e answer is B. Th  e objective is to straighten the ear \\r\\ncanal so that the drops are easily instilled. In a child, this is \\r\\naccomplished by pulling the ear backward and downward.

Th   e answer is C (I and II). Titanium dioxide is a physi-\\r\\ncal sunscreen agent that blocks ultraviolet radiation over \\r\\nboth the UVA and UVB spectrum (actually over the  entire \\r\\nsolar spectrum). Ecamsule (Mexoryl SX) helps protect \\r\\nagainst short UVA rays whereas avobenzone (Parsol 1789) \\r\\nhelps protect against long UVA rays, and octocrylene helps \\r\\nprotect against UVB rays. Th  ese three sunscreen agents are \\r\\ncombined into a product (Anthelios Sx) which provides both \\r\\nUVA and UVB protection. Homosalate and padimate O \\r\\nblock only UVB radiation. 21. Th  e answer is B. Combination cancer chemotherapy \\r\\nregimens are used to improve survival and response out-\\r\\ncomes for cancer treatment, and usually involve two or more \\r\\nagents. Drugs given in combination generally should have \\r\\ndiff erent mechanisms of action, should act during diff erent \\r\\ncell cycle phases, should have known activity as single agents, \\r\\nand should be associated with diff erent adverse eff ects. Cell \\r\\ncycle–specifi c drugs may be given in combination with cell \\r\\ncycle–nonspecifi c agents. 22. Th  e answer is A. Cyclophosphamide is an alkylating \\r\\nagent. Th  ese agents affi  x an alkyl group to cellular DNA, \\r\\ncausing cross-linking of DNA strands, which triggers cell \\r\\ndeath. Cell cycle–nonspecifi c agents kill nondividing as well \\r\\nas dividing cells. 23. Th  e answer is B (III). Only docetaxel is associated with a \\r\\nlow incidence of nausea and vomiting. Both cyclophosphamide \\r\\nand doxorubicin are associated with moderate incidences of \\r\\nnausea and vomiting (31% to 90%), which are caused largely \\r\\nby stimulation of the chemoreceptor trigger zone in the brain. 24. Th e answer is C (I and II). Docetaxel (Taxotere) \\r\\nmay cause fl uid retention leading to pulmonary edema. Dexamethasone is administered to help prevent this  eff ect. Dexamethasone is also an adjuvant antiemetic for pre-\\r\\nvention of nausea and vomiting due to the doxorubicin- \\r\\ncyclophosphamide components of TAC chemotherapy. Premedication with dexamethasone and H1 and H2 antago-\\r\\nnists is required for paclitaxel (Taxol) to prevent potential \\r\\nhypersensitivity reactions. 25. Th  e answer is E. Both doxorubicin and docetaxel are \\r\\nconsidered to be vesicants. Vesicants cause extreme irrita-\\r\\ntion and may cause tissue necrosis if they extravasate or leak \\r\\nfrom blood vessels into surrounding tissues. Placement of \\r\\nIn an adult patient, the ear canal is straightened by pulling it \\r\\nbackward and upward. 13. Th  e answer is A. Carbamide peroxide is eff ective  in \\r\\nsoft ening, loosening, and helping remove cerumen from \\r\\nthe ear canal. Although the other agents have been used in \\r\\npractice for years, there are no data to support their effi  cacy \\r\\nabove carbamide peroxide in anhydrous glycerin. Sweet oil is \\r\\nanother name for olive oil. 14. Th  e answer is A. Mineral oil (liquid petrolatum) is the \\r\\nonly OTC lubricant laxative available. It may rarely be rec-\\r\\nommended in situations in which a soft  stool is warranted, \\r\\nto avoid the patient from straining. In most of these cases, \\r\\na stool soft ener would be preferable (e.g., docusate sodium). Lipid pneumonia may result if the patient takes this medica-\\r\\ntion while lying down. It should not be given to  bedridden \\r\\npatients or before bedtime for ambulatory patients. It should \\r\\nbe taken on an empty stomach because taking it with meals \\r\\nwill delay gastric emptying.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"6f1b71e8-6de4-4088-ae30-353ca077f6fe":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"6f1b71e8-6de4-4088-ae30-353ca077f6fe\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"4EhL7pWsnmD3p0VJJNdVtPOOpO575/rntk5vkS7hgJo=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"xzywh7P+1PRtyZ587E21G4K98ncPnVsFd6WW1RI+I0w=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"8c0f9ac8-4884-4046-9389-de6392a1ab43\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"20D+L7IeXZV9rn9krgzE6b+Zq7Hty9ZIzelZBHSZmXU=\"}},\"hash\":\"wDH3u2OCac5tV653NAxoNB2A/+ZUiRRX/M+MaD/lyJI=\",\"text\":\"Although the clinical  eff ect  is \\r\\n uncertain, mineral oil may decrease the absorption of fat-\\r\\nsoluble vitamins A, D, E, and K.

Symptoms of hemorrhoids such as \\r\\nburning, discomfort, irritation, infl ammation, itching, pain, \\r\\nand swelling can all be treated safely and eff ectively  with \\r\\n various OTC agents. Patients with bleeding, seepage, pro-\\r\\nlapse, thrombosis, and severe pain should be referred to a \\r\\nphysician to rule out a cause other than a hemorrhoid. 16. Th   e answer is D. All of the agents would be eff ective for \\r\\ntreating itching from hemorrhoids. Anusol HC-1 contains \\r\\nhydrocortisone, and Anusol ointment contains pramoxine \\r\\n(OTC topical anesthetic). Preparation H cream contains \\r\\nphenylephrine in addition to shark liver oil, petrolatum, and \\r\\nglycerin.

An appropriate warning label \\r\\nagainst its use in hypertensive patients is on the product. 17. Th   e answer is E (I, II, and III). Celecoxib (Celebrex) is \\r\\na COX-2 inhibitor used for pain and infl ammation of rheu-\\r\\nmatoid arthritis. Th  ese agents do not alter the course of the \\r\\ndisease, nor do they prevent joint destruction. Warnings \\r\\nconcerning postmarketing reports of serious skin reactions \\r\\nand hypersensitivity reactions in patients receiving this drug \\r\\nwere issued in November 2002.

Ophthalmic ointments are \\r\\nlisted separately by the USP as ointments for application to \\r\\nthe eye. 35. Th e answer is D. Ramelteon (Rozerem) is the fi rst \\r\\nagent that acts on the melatonin system, binding to the mela-\\r\\ntonin 1 and melatonin 2 receptors in the brain. Eszopiclone \\r\\n(Lunesta), zaleplon (Sonata), and zolpidem (Ambien) are \\r\\nbenzodiazepine agonists that bind to the \\u000b-aminobutyric \\r\\nacid 1 (GABA-1) receptor and the benzodiazepine recep-\\r\\ntor, but they are not benzodiazepines in structure. Triazolam \\r\\n(Halcion) is structurally a benzodiazepine that binds to the \\r\\nbenzodiazepine receptor on the GABA-A receptor complex. 36. Th  e answer is E. Montelukast should be taken in the \\r\\nevening if it is prescribed for asthma. Montelukast may be \\r\\nadministered without regard to meal times. It is used to treat \\r\\nsymptoms of allergic rhinitis so these should not increase. It is not FDA approved for use in the reversal of acute bron-\\r\\nchospasm in asthma. Montelukast is a leukotriene antagonist \\r\\nwhereas Spiriva (tiotropium) is an anticholinergic agent. 37. Th   e answer is D. Hydrochlorothiazide by itself causes \\r\\nhypokalemia. Triamterene-hydrochlorothiazide (Dyazide), \\r\\nand spironolactone-hydrochlorothiazide (Aldactazide) ob-\\r\\nviously contain the thiazide diuretic hydrochlorothiazide \\r\\n(HCTZ), which can cause hypokalemia. However,  Dyazide \\r\\nand Aldactazide contain a potassium-sparing diuretic, \\r\\nwhich helps prevent potassium losses. Enalapril (Vasotec) \\r\\nis an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor that inhibits \\r\\npotassium loss from the kidney by inhibiting angiotensin \\r\\neff ects. Eplerenone is a selective aldosterone blocker which \\r\\ncan cause the serum potassium to increase. 38. Th e answer is D. LMWHs (tinzaparin, dalteparin, \\r\\nenoxaparin) can be given without anticoagulation moni-\\r\\ntoring because they have a more predictable dose-response \\r\\nrelationship. LMWHs have longer half-lives than unfrac-\\r\\ntionated heparin and can be administered subcutaneously \\r\\nwith  greater bioavailability. LMWHs are also associated with \\r\\na lower risk of adverse eff ects typical of heparin, such as \\r\\nthrombocytopenia and osteoporosis. 39. Th  e answer is D.

Th  e answer is B (III only). Chemotherapy-induced \\r\\nnausea and vomiting is best controlled by preventing it \\r\\nwith an appropriate antiemetic regimen. Nausea and vom-\\r\\niting, common occurrences with many chemotherapeutic \\r\\ndrugs, result from stimulation of the brain’s CTZ. Some pa-\\r\\ntients experience anticipatory nausea and vomiting before \\r\\ngetting chemotherapy and this is best managed through \\r\\nthe use of a benzodiazepine (such as lorazepam) prior \\r\\nto treatment. Severe nausea and vomiting may reduce \\r\\npatient tolerance to treatment regimens. Eff ective use of \\r\\n antiemetic drug regimens is an important adjunct to suc-\\r\\ncessful  chemotherapy. 29. Th  e answer is A (I only). Although all three drugs are \\r\\nreliable antistaphylococcal therapy, Ms. Smith’s history of \\r\\npenicillin allergy is a contraindication for the use of penicil-\\r\\nlin derivatives such as dicloxacillin and Unasyn (ampicillin \\r\\nand sulbactam). Vancomycin (Vancocin) is not a penicillin \\r\\nderivative and is a valuable alternative for penicillin-sensitive \\r\\npatients. It has excellent activity against S. aureus (including \\r\\nmost methicillin-resistant strains). 30. Th  e answer is A. Linezolid (Zyvox) is eff ective  treat-\\r\\nment for vancomycin-resistant S. aureus. Vancocin is a brand \\r\\nof vancomycin, to which the organism has demonstrated \\r\\n resistance. Rocephin, meropenem, and Cedax (ceft ibuten) \\r\\nare generally ineff ective for vancomycin-resistant S. aureus. 31. Th e answer is B (III only).

Gouty arthritis attacks occur acutely \\r\\nwith complete resolution aft er a few days. Th e morning \\r\\nstiff ness described in choice A is typical of rheumatoid ar-\\r\\nthritis. Metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal \\r\\njoint involvement is classic for rheumatoid arthritis. Gouty \\r\\narthritis most commonly aff ects the fi rst metatarsophalan-\\r\\ngeal joint of the big toe. Gouty arthritis attacks typically \\r\\noccur suddenly in the middle of the night. Th is scenario \\r\\nmatches the pharmacist’s note in the profi le. Joint infl am-\\r\\nmation with simultaneous involvement of the same joint \\r\\nareas on both sides of the body may be characteristic of \\r\\nrheumatoid arthritis. 49. Th  e answer is B (III). Commit lozenges contain nico-\\r\\ntine polacrilex (the same ingredient as nicotine gum), which \\r\\nis one of the newer dosage forms for nicotine replacement. Patients are instructed to use the 2-mg or 4-mg strength \\r\\nbased on the amount of time aft er awakening when the urge \\r\\nto smoke  occurs. Patients who have this urge within 30 min-\\r\\nutes should use the 4-mg product. 50. Th  e answer is A. Although not generally given as fi rst-\\r\\nline agents, corticosteroids (e.g., oral prednisone) may be \\r\\nused to treat acute gouty arthritis. NSAIDs and oral colchi-\\r\\ncine are the usual fi rst-line agents. A positive response to col-\\r\\nchicine may help confi  rm the diagnosis of acute gouty arthri-\\r\\ntis, but other causes of acute arthritis may respond positively \\r\\nto this agent. Choices C, D, and E are “classic” components of \\r\\ngout. Mr. Trombone’s presentation per his phone call to the \\r\\npharmacy matches the descriptions in choices C and E. Th e \\r\\nserum uric acid reported in Mr. Trombone’s profi  le (11.5 mg/\\r\\ndL) is elevated. 51. Th  e answer is A (I). Aspirin in low doses (\\f 2 g/day) \\r\\ninhibits the tubular secretion of uric acid, causing uric acid \\r\\nto be retained. For the treatment of minor pain such as head-\\r\\nache, dosages for both aspirin and acetaminophen are essen-\\r\\ntially the same. Reye syndrome, an acute and  potentially fatal \\r\\nillness, occurs with rare exceptions in children \\f 15 years. Fatty liver with encephalopathy develops with this syndrome. Th  e onset most oft en follows an infl uenza or chickenpox in-\\r\\nfection. Th  e risk for this syndrome increases with salicylate \\r\\ningestion. Because of Mr. Trombone’s age, he is not at risk for \\r\\nthis condition. 52. Th  e answer is B. By almost a 10:1 margin, gout aff ects \\r\\nmore males than females.

Leucovorin (citrovorum factor) is used to neutralize the \\r\\n eff ects of MTX. 44. Th   e answer is A. Loperamide interferes with  peristalsis \\r\\nto slow GI motility which minimizes the excretion of the \\r\\nexotoxins of C. diffi  cile.

It is the most commonly used indicator for obesity. Height and weight charts are available to quickly determine \\r\\nthis number. A BMI \\r 30 defi nes obesity. Gradual weight \\r\\nloss does result in a decrease in serum uric acid. 46. Th e answer is B (III). Phentermine is structurally \\r\\n similar to amphetamine, but it has less severe central ner-\\r\\nvous system stimulation. Because it can cause signifi cant \\r\\nincreases in blood pressure, its use in hypertensive patients \\r\\nis not advisable. His BMI of 30 justifi es the use of pharmaco-\\r\\ntherapy-facilitated weight loss (a BMI of 27 justifi es the use \\r\\nof drug therapy if other risk factors such as hypertension are \\r\\npresent); however, another agent without the adverse eff ect \\r\\non blood pressure should probably be selected. Th  ere is no \\r\\ncontraindication to the use of phentermine in a patient with \\r\\ngout. 47. Th   e answer is A (I). In 2007, Orlistat (Alli) became the \\r\\nfi rst weight loss drug offi  cially sanctioned by the U.S. gov-\\r\\nernment for OTC use. Th  e sympathomimetic agent phenyl-\\r\\npropanolamine and the topical anesthetic benzocaine were \\r\\noriginally ruled as safe and eff ective OTC weight loss drugs. Because of safety issues (hemorrhagic stroke), phenylpropa-\\r\\nnolamine was removed from the OTC drug market.

Harmless darkening of the tongue can also occur with \\r\\nbismuth subsalicylate use. 58. Th  e answer is C (I and II). Lactose intolerance is rel-\\r\\natively common. Disaccharides, like lactose and sucrose, \\r\\nare normally hydrolyzed by lactase. If lactase is not pres-\\r\\nent, these disaccharides may produce an osmotic diarrhea. Products such as Lactaid Original, which contain lactase, \\r\\ncan be  administered before eating dairy products to relieve \\r\\nthis problem. Also, lactose-free milk products can be used in \\r\\nplace of regular milk. Calcium, although probably not in the \\r\\ndoses present in various dairy products, will eventually cause \\r\\nconstipation, not diarrhea. 59. Th  e answer is C (I and II). An SPF of 30 blocks about \\r\\n97% of UVB radiation and would certainly provide maxi-\\r\\nmal protection against sunburn. Any benefi t from using \\r\\nSPFs above 30 would be negligible. All sun-exposed sur-\\r\\nfaces should be covered liberally and evenly. An average-size \\r\\nadult in a swimsuit would require about 1 oz per applica-\\r\\ntion. Perspiration, swimming, and toweling off  all contribute \\r\\nto the need for reapplication. Th  e SPF is a measure of only \\r\\nUVB protection. UVA radiation, which is relatively constant \\r\\nthroughout the day, is not blocked by sunscreen agents that \\r\\nare limited to the UVB spectrum. Th  e sunscreen agent avo-\\r\\nbenzone blocks most of the UVA rays. 60. Th   e answer is D. Ferrous sulfate (Feosol) and fumarate \\r\\nhave higher percentages of elemental iron than the gluconate \\r\\nsalt. Enteric-coated formulations do not dissolve until they \\r\\nenter the small intestine, which causes a reduction in iron \\r\\nabsorption. Th  e other statements concerning iron supple-\\r\\nmentation are correct. 61. Th   e answer is E (I, II, III). Iron-defi  ciency anemia usu-\\r\\nally produces a microcytic hypochromic type of anemia. Th e \\r\\nred blood cells are smaller and lighter in color than normal. Th  e hemoglobin level in the blood will be low. Red blood cell \\r\\nindices such as MCV and the mean cell hemoglobin concen-\\r\\ntration (MCHC) will both be low, refl ecting the microcytic \\r\\nand hypochromic nature of the red cells. Total iron-binding \\r\\ncapacity will be high. 62. Th  e answer is B (III). Iron preparations form a chelate \\r\\nwith tetracycline, inhibiting its absorption; therefore, iron \\r\\npreparations should not be administered with oral tetra-\\r\\ncyclines. If a patient needs both types of therapy, the iron \\r\\n product should be administered 3 hours before or 2 hours \\r\\naft er the tetracycline to minimize the adverse interaction. 63. Th e answer is E (I, II, and III). Common organ-\\r\\nisms that can cause PID include N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis. Empiric treatment is, therefore, directed toward \\r\\nacid excreted by the body is through the kidneys, and this \\r\\nis helpful in using drugs such as probenecid, which aids in \\r\\nthe excretion of uric acid through the kidneys. High-purine \\r\\nfoods (i.e., organ meats) should be avoided because these \\r\\nmay increase serum uric acid levels. Colchicine has no eff ect \\r\\non serum uric acid levels. Most clinicians now select NSAIDs \\r\\nover colchicine because of the high incidence of diarrhea \\r\\nfrom colchicine. 53. Th   e answer is E (I, II, and III). Initially, acute gouty ar-\\r\\nthritis attacks resolve completely, usually with no residual ef-\\r\\nfects. Th  e repeated attacks of gouty arthritis and the fact that \\r\\nhis serum uric acid level is elevated would indicate the need \\r\\nfor uric acid–lowering therapy. Prophylactic low doses of col-\\r\\nchicine (usually 0.5 to 1.0 mg/day) may help  prevent acute \\r\\n attacks of gouty arthritis, especially during the initiation of \\r\\nuric acid–lowering therapy.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"4401f304-5e58-40bf-8d9f-4209142aefe8":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"4401f304-5e58-40bf-8d9f-4209142aefe8\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"bP1Qc5/SpKD7Upl3XRjZ6QdobC7JeKgskKAFBX2xY6E=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"NNzkfB1kzQyfuhvFYlCiX44VVs1iqUPNB0o2c54wbio=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"6f04fe7e-122e-4ee7-935c-c74a69760233\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"YYHWGrPB4wKJ62LeF2WncbnbGyOhcULj13K9D4ZMDVc=\"}},\"hash\":\"l01RJnS+k0yQ0/sDvIW+YHGwD9oQgkSmVZv9HPyUX2o=\",\"text\":\"Th  iazide diuretics (hydrochloro-\\r\\nthiazide) may cause hyperuricemia, and switching this patient \\r\\nto a diff erent antihypertensive agent would be appropriate. 54. Th  e answer is C (I and II). Allopurinol (Zyloprim) is \\r\\na xanthine oxidase inhibitor that works to prevent uric acid \\r\\nformation from xanthine. Th e long half-life of the main \\r\\n active metabolite (oxypurinol) permits the drug to be dosed \\r\\njust once daily. Unlike the uricosuric agent (probenecid), \\r\\nwhich blocks tubular absorption of uric acid resulting in in-\\r\\ncreased amounts of uric acid in the urine, allopurinol actu-\\r\\nally decreases uric acid formation. Th  erefore, increased fl uid \\r\\nintake is not required as it is with the uricosuric drugs. 55. Th   e answer is E (I, II, and III). To use the OTC agents, \\r\\na woman must have had this condition once before, must \\r\\nhave had it diagnosed by a physician previously, and must \\r\\n experience the same type of symptoms. Th  ese agents are \\r\\navailable in 1-, 3-, and 7-day regimens. Th  ese are all “azole” \\r\\nantifungal agents. Th  e characteristic symptoms are noted in \\r\\nchoice III. Other vaginal conditions that are not amenable to \\r\\nOTC treatment will produce symptoms that require medical \\r\\nreferral, such as a malodorous discharge and dysuria. 56. Th  e answer is D (II and III). Kaolin by itself (with-\\r\\nout  pectin), bismuth subsalicylate, and loperamide are now \\r\\nconsidered safe and eff ective by the FDA for OTC use for \\r\\ndiarrhea. Also lactase products are specifi cally indicated for \\r\\nlactose-intolerant patients. Attapulgite and calcium polycar-\\r\\nbophil, which were previously considered safe and eff ective, \\r\\nwere reclassifi  ed in April 2003 as Class III agents  owing to in-\\r\\nsuffi  cient eff ectiveness data. Even though the FDA has grant-\\r\\ned kaolin monograph status, no single-ingredient  kaolin \\r\\nproducts are currently available in the United States. 57. Th   e answer is E (I, II, and III). Pepto Bismol does con-\\r\\ntain bismuth subsalicylate.

Fidaxomicin (Difi cid) is the most recently \\r\\napproved alternative to these agents. Fidaxomicin has been \\r\\nshown to be noninferior with vancomycin with a signifi -\\r\\ncantly lower rate of recurrence of C. diffi  cile. 71. Th  e answer is C. Ketoconazole is an oral agent eff ec-\\r\\ntive for treating systemic fungal infections. Butoconazole, \\r\\nclotrimazole, and miconazole are administered topically \\r\\nor vaginally for local infection. Nystatin is a polyene anti-\\r\\nfungal antibiotic, not a substituted imidazole derivative. It is available for topical and vaginal administration to treat \\r\\n local infections. Nystatin oral tablets are not absorbed and \\r\\nare, therefore, therapeutic only for infections of the GI tract, \\r\\n especially oral and esophageal Candida infections. 72. Th  e answer is D (II and III). Phenytoin, primidone, \\r\\nand carbamazepine are all agents indicated for treatment of \\r\\ngeneralized tonic–clonic seizures. Primidone metabolizes to \\r\\nphenobarbital; therefore, patients who are allergic to phe-\\r\\nnobarbital should not receive primidone. Carbamazepine is \\r\\ncontraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to tricyclic \\r\\nantidepressants, such as amitriptyline. 73. Th  e answer is C (I and II). Tegretol and Depakote are \\r\\nboth slow-release products of carbamazepine and divalproex \\r\\npreparations and should not be crushed. All slow-released \\r\\nproducts must remain intact to prevent dissolution in the \\r\\nstomach. 74. Th   e answer is E (I, II, and III). Although the  mechanism \\r\\nhas only been speculated, the impact that phenytoin might \\r\\nhave on the metabolism of folic acid is responsible for the \\r\\ndevelopment of select anemias (i.e., megaloblastic), as well as \\r\\nthe potential development of gingival hyperplasia (an over-\\r\\ngrowth of the gums), both of which might be avoided through \\r\\nthe supplementation of folic acid. Stevens– Johnson syndrome \\r\\nis an autoimmune and life-threatening skin  reaction. 75. Th   e answer is B. Th  e normal therapeutic range for phe-\\r\\nnytoin serum levels is 10 to 20 \\tg/mL. Nystagmus, ataxia, \\r\\nand slurred speech have been reported with serum levels of \\r\\n20 to 30 \\tg/mL, with coma reported when the level reaches \\r\\n40 \\tg/mL. eradicating these organisms. One of the options for empiric \\r\\noutpatient treatment uses a combination regimen of  cefoxitin \\r\\ngiven intramuscularly once followed by  doxycycline  given \\r\\nfor 14 days. 64. Th  e answer is B (III). Th  e patient does not have any \\r\\nsymptoms of gout or any notation of an elevated uric acid \\r\\nlevel. Benemid (probenecid) could be used for long-term \\r\\nmanagement of those two conditions, but she received only \\r\\none dose. Probenecid competes with the tubular secretion \\r\\nof \\u0006-lactam antibiotics, resulting in prolongation of serum \\r\\n levels. Th e Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \\r\\n(CDC) recommendations for pelvic infl ammatory  disease \\r\\ninclude probenecid as part of the regimen. 65. Th e answer is A.

Tetracyclines are broad-spectrum \\r\\nagents eff ective against gram-negative and gram-positive \\r\\norganisms, spirochetes, Mycoplasma and Chlamydia organ-\\r\\nisms, rickettsial species, and certain protozoa. Phototoxic \\r\\nreactions (enhanced sunburn) can develop with exposure to \\r\\nsunlight. Doxycycline has the least binding affi  nity for cal-\\r\\ncium ions of any of the tetracyclines, but the net eff ect is a \\r\\nslight decrease in absorption, not an increase. Unlike other \\r\\ntetracycline derivatives, food and/or antacids do not signifi -\\r\\ncantly inhibit absorption of doxycycline. GI distress is a com-\\r\\nmon adverse eff ect of all tetracyclines; it may be minimized \\r\\nby concurrent administration with food. 67. Th   e answer is E (I, II, and III). Tetracyclines are main-\\r\\nly bacteriostatic, but at high concentrations they can be bac-\\r\\ntericidal. Th  ey inhibit bacterial protein synthesis by binding \\r\\nto the 30S and possibly the 50S ribosomal subunit(s), thus \\r\\ninterfering with the transfer of genetic information. Th ey \\r\\nmay also inhibit the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane, reduc-\\r\\ning membrane stability and thus causing bacterial cell lysis. 68. Th  e answer is E (I, II, and III). Single-dose oral fl uco-\\r\\nnazole has been shown to have clinical effi  cacy as good as or \\r\\nbetter than topical antifungal products. Because it can be giv-\\r\\nen as a single oral tablet, it is considered cleaner than topical \\r\\nagents, many of which need to be dosed three or more times \\r\\nto reach the effi  cacy aff orded by one oral dose of fl uconazole.

Bismuth compounds discolor the stool and tongue to be \\r\\nblack; this may alarm patients because black stools may also \\r\\nbe a sign of blood (GI bleeding). Large doses of bismuth sub-\\r\\nsalicylate in combination with aspirin may cause salicylate \\r\\ntoxicity. It is indicated for the treatment of acute diarrhea. 106. The answer is E. If misoprostol is given with mag-\\r\\nnesium-containing antacids, it may increase the risk of \\r\\ndiarrhea (not constipation). Misoprostol is approved to \\r\\nprotect patients from NSAID-induced gastric ulcers. Misoprostol is a synthetic prostaglandin that appears to \\r\\nsuppress gastric acid secretion and may provide a muco-\\r\\nsal protective effect. It is used in patients taking NSAID \\r\\ntherapy to counter the  undesired effect that these com-\\r\\npounds exert on prostaglandin activity in the parietal cell \\r\\nof the gastric mucosa. Misoprostol is contraindicated in \\r\\npregnant women because it may induce spontaneous uter-\\r\\nine contractions. 107. Th  e answer is D.

Th  e answer is E (I, II, and III). NSAIDs such as ibu-\\r\\nprofen are inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis. Although \\r\\nthe inhi bition is an important mechanism for anti-infl am-\\r\\nmatory therapy, it also compromises the protective eff ects \\r\\nthat prostaglandins exert on the gastric mucosa.

Cefuroxime oft en is prescribed as an alterna-\\r\\ntive to ampicillin (as is cefamandole) to treat community-\\r\\nacquired pneumonia and is administered in a dosage of 2.25 \\r\\nto 4.50 g per day, which is divided and given every 8 hours. All cephalosporins should be used cautiously in penicillin-\\r\\nallergic patients. 120. Th  e answer is C. Atrovent (ipratropium) should not \\r\\nbe used for symptom relief or for exacerbations of broncho-\\r\\nspasm. Th  e onset of action is within 15 minutes, and the \\r\\nagent is useful mainly for maintenance regimens in patients \\r\\nwith COPD and some patients with asthma. Th   e other agents \\r\\nlisted have more rapid onsets (within 5 minutes) and are \\r\\n useful to relieve acute bronchospasm. 121. Th  e answer is B. Amoxicillin has a spectrum of anti-\\r\\nmicrobial activity similar to that of ampicillin. It has a longer \\r\\nhalf-life, which allows less frequent dosing (250 to 500 mg \\r\\nevery 8 hours, as opposed to ampicillin, which is given in \\r\\na dosage of 250 mg to 2 g every 4 to 6 hours). Both drugs \\r\\nmay produce an erythematous, maculopapular rash not \\r\\nseen with other penicillins. Amoxicillin has more complete \\r\\noral  absorption than ampicillin—a characteristic that may \\r\\n explain the lower frequency of diarrhea as a side eff ect. It is \\r\\ncontraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity \\r\\nto other penicillins. 122. Th  e answer is A (I). With this patient’s recent history \\r\\nof rash caused by amoxicillin, ampicillin should be avoided \\r\\nbecause an erythematous, maculopapular rash or an urti-\\r\\ncarial hypersensitivity is seen with other penicillins.

Th  e answer is B. Anemia is a common complication \\r\\nof chronic renal failure caused by a decrease in production of \\r\\nerythropoietin and endocrine product in the kidney. Eryth-\\r\\nropoietin, or epoetin \\u0005 (Epogen, Procrit), stimulates red \\r\\nblood cell production in the bone marrow. Th is production \\r\\nis refl ected by an increase in hematocrit and hemoglobin \\r\\nand a decrease in the need for blood transfusions. Recently, \\r\\nerythropoietin has been approved for the treatment of ane-\\r\\nmia in HIV-positive patients or for the prevention of anemia \\r\\nowing to zidovudine (AZT). 131. Th  e answer is C. Th  e most frequently reported ad-\\r\\nverse eff ects of raloxifene include hot fl ashes (up to 28% of \\r\\nwomen) and leg cramps (5.9%). Raloxifene has not been \\r\\nassociated with irregular uterine bleeding or breast tender-\\r\\nness. GI complaints and allergic manifestations occur less \\r\\nfrequently. 132. Th  e answer is E (I, II, and III). Emulsifying agents, \\r\\nalso known as wetting agents, surfactants, or surface-active \\r\\nagents (e.g., soaps, sodium lauryl sulfate, and dioctyl sodium \\r\\nsulfosuccinate), lower the surface and interfacial  tension. Th ese agents permit more intimate contact between an \\r\\n aqueous (water) phase and a lipid phase. 133. Th  e answer is C. Amitiza (lubiprostone) is indicated \\r\\nfor treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation in adults. 134. Th   e answer is E (I, II, and III). Pyrimethamine, trim-\\r\\nethoprim, and methotrexate act on the folic acid pathway to \\r\\ninhibit reduction of dihydrofolic acid to tetrahydrofolic acid \\r\\nby the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase. 135. Th  e answer is D. Salicylic acid is commonly used \\r\\nexternally as a keratolytic in corn and wart preparations \\r\\n(e.g., Wart-Off  and Freezone) to remove the horny layers of \\r\\nthe skin in a process known as desquamation. 136. Th  e answer is D. Products containing benzoyl perox-\\r\\nide, sulfur, salicylic acid (3% to 6%), and resorcinol (1% to \\r\\n2%) have been shown to be eff ective agents in the treatment \\r\\nof acne vulgaris. Benzoyl peroxide (Loroxide), salicylic acid \\r\\n(PROPA pH), sulfur (Liquimat), and resorcinol and sulfur \\r\\n(Rezamid Lotion) are available OTC anti-acne products.

Patients with type 1, or insulin-\\r\\ndependent, diabetes are normally younger; are not obese; \\r\\nhave an absolute lack of insulin in the pancreas; and are pre-\\r\\ndisposed to ketoacidosis if they do not receive insulin. 138. Th  e answer is B. Th  e choices are all steroids. Estro-\\r\\ngenic steroids have an aromatic A ring. Progesterone and \\r\\nother progestins are derivatives of pregnane. 123. Th  e answer is D. For optimal dose retention, patients \\r\\nshould be instructed to wait 1 minute between each puff . Longer waits between puff s are unnecessary and may con-\\r\\ntribute to nonadherence to the prescribed regimen. Patients \\r\\n using steroid inhalers, especially, should be instructed to rinse \\r\\nwell aft  er completing their dosing.

Th  eophylline is an agent \\r\\nthat depends on the cytochrome P450 microsomal enzyme \\r\\nfor its metabolism. Tobacco tars and phenobarbital are both \\r\\nconsidered to be enzyme inducers of the cytochrome P450 \\r\\nmicrosomal enzyme system; consequently, theophylline me-\\r\\ntabolism may be increased in patients taking these agents \\r\\nconcurrently. Th e H2-receptor antagonists cimetidine and \\r\\nranitidine have both been shown to inhibit the P450 enzyme \\r\\nsystem and thus reduce theophylline metabolism.

Th  e MIC for gentamicin returned \\r\\nback as 4, and based on the available serum levels and the \\r\\nneed to exceed the MIC by four to fi ve times; it would appear \\r\\nthat gentamicin is not the appropriate agent in this patient. Tobramycin would be an appropriate alternative to the cur-\\r\\nrent gentamicin regimen with a returning MIC of 0.5 \\tg/mL. 146. Th  e answer is B. True cross-reactivity between ceph-\\r\\nalosporin antibiotics and penicillin is considered rare. Commonly, the rate of cross-reactivity is approximately 10%, \\r\\nand the future use of a cephalosporin is dependent on the \\r\\ndegree of reported previous reactions for a patient receiving \\r\\na penicillin (local rash vs. anaphylaxis). 147. Th  e answer is C. If the patient is receiving 16 mg \\r\\n theophylline per hour by IV infusion, then the patient should \\r\\nreceive the oral dose of theophylline at the same approximate \\r\\ndosing rate:\\r\\nTh eophylline dose \\u0007 16 mg \\u0004 24 hours \\u0007 384 mg\\r\\nTh  erefore, the patient should be given 400 mg of \\r\\n theophylline controlled-release product every 24 hours, \\r\\ninitially with necessary follow-up. 148. Th  e answer is E (I, II, and III). Conversion from IV \\r\\nto oral theophylline dosing should be accomplished using a \\r\\n sustained-release  theophylline preparation designed to deliver \\r\\na daily dose of theophylline comparable to the dose from the \\r\\nIV infusion. Due to potential variabilities among the absorp-\\r\\ntion characteristics of orally administered  products, there is \\r\\na greater variability in drug concentrations for orally admin-\\r\\nistered theophylline products as compared to IV infusions. A steady-state theophylline level is achievable if no doses \\r\\nare missed within the preceding 48-hour period. Reasonable \\r\\n sampling time should be within 3 to 7 hours of dosing. 139. Th  e answer is D. Any disturbance in the balance be-\\r\\ntween dopaminergic receptors and cholinergic receptors \\r\\nseems to result in various movement disorders. Increases in \\r\\nacetylcholine and decreases in dopamine, norepinephrine, \\r\\nserotonin, or GABA have been linked to the development \\r\\nof various forms of Parkinson disease.

Half-normal saline solution (0.45% \\r\\nsodium chloride) has an osmotic pressure less than that of \\r\\nblood and is referred to as a hypotonic solution. Isotonic \\r\\nand isosmotic solutions have osmotic pressures that are \\r\\nequal to blood.

Th  e answer is B. Aluminum hydroxide (Amphojel) \\r\\nis used in patients with renal failure because it binds excess \\r\\nphosphate in the intestine, thereby reducing the serum phos-\\r\\nphate concentration. Th  e aluminum hydroxide can be in \\r\\n liquid or tablet form and is administered three or four times \\r\\ndaily with meals. 159. Th  e answer is A. Kayexalate, or sodium polystyrene \\r\\nsulfonate (SPS), is an ion-exchange resin that exchanges so-\\r\\ndium ion for potassium in the intestines. SPS, with its potas-\\r\\nsium content, is excreted in the feces. Th  e result is a decrease \\r\\nin potassium levels in the serum and other body fl uids. 160. Th e answer is A. Chronic renal failure causes a \\r\\n normochromic, normocytic anemia, usually refl ected in a \\r\\ndecreased hemoglobin and decreased hematocrit. In most \\r\\npatients, the hematocrit is between 20% and 30%. 161. Th   e answer is D (II and III). Th   e major route of elimi-\\r\\nnation for both digoxin and tobramycin (an aminoglycoside) \\r\\nis the kidney. Both medications require dosage adjustment \\r\\nin patients with acute or chronic renal failure. Haloperidol \\r\\nis mainly metabolized by the liver and, therefore, would not \\r\\nneed dosage adjustment. 149. Th   e answer is C (I and II). To demonstrate bioequiva-\\r\\nlency of two products, both must be the same dosage form \\r\\n(e.g.,  both must be controlled-release tablets), both must \\r\\ncontain the same amount of the same active ingredient, and \\r\\nboth must be given in the same dose and via the same route \\r\\nof administration. Th   is study is a relative bioavailability study \\r\\nto demonstrate the controlled-release characteristics of the \\r\\nextended-release tablet. Note: Bioequivalence implies that \\r\\nboth drug products have the same rate and extent of systemic \\r\\ndrug absorption. Th  e pharmacist must consider whether the \\r\\ndiff erence in pharmacokinetic profi les lead to diff erences in \\r\\npharmacodynamic eff ects. 150. Th  e answer is C. It is recommended that COPD pa-\\r\\ntients receive infl uenza vaccine annually, usually in the fall.

Passive diff usion fol-\\r\\nlows Fick’s principle of diff usion, in which the rate of dif-\\r\\nfusion depends on the concentration gradient, the partition \\r\\ncoeffi  cient (e.g., lipid solubility to water solubility ratio), and \\r\\nthe surface area of the cell membrane.

Th   e answer is B [see Tab l e 56-2]. Measles is acquired through respiratory droplets from an in-\\r\\nfected individual. 4. Th   e answer is C [see 56.IV.E.3]. Some viruses, such as measles, modulate the immune re-\\r\\nsponse, resulting in increased susceptibility to secondary \\r\\ninfections. With measles, respiratory involvement is particu-\\r\\nlarly common and respiratory complications can be due to \\r\\n primary viral invasion or secondary infection by  bacteria, \\r\\nusually Streptococcus pneumoniae. Bacterial  secondary infec-\\r\\ntions are so commonplace that prophylactic antibiotic treat-\\r\\nment is oft en practiced in endemic regions; however, that \\r\\npractice is not universally accepted. Measles is not treated \\r\\nwith antibiotics that target bacteria. In areas of the world \\r\\nwhere individuals may be undernourished, vitamin A supple-\\r\\nmentation reduces the incidence of measles  complications. 1. Th   e answer is A [see 56.IV.E.2]. Rashes (exanthems) are oft en due to the immune response \\r\\ndirected to viral antigens, and thus to infected cells (e.g., \\r\\nmeasles, parvovirus B19). Without a functioning immune \\r\\nsystem the rash will not develop. Immunocompromised pa-\\r\\ntients should not receive most live attenuated vaccines. How-\\r\\never, it is important that patients who might otherwise have \\r\\na weakened immune system develop immunity to infectious \\r\\nagents they might encounter. Th  e current recommendation \\r\\nwith regard to HIV\\u0002 individuals is that adults with CD4 \\r\\n T-lymphocyte  counts \\u0004 200 cells/\\u0003L should not receive the \\r\\nMMR vaccine. 2. Th   e answer is D [see 56.IV.D.2]. Viral infections, such as measles and respiratory syncytial \\r\\nvirus, can lead to fusion of neighboring cells, forming giant \\r\\nmultinucleated cells (syncytia). Other host cells infected by \\r\\nviruses might have unusual appearances, such as neural cells \\r\\ninfected with rabies virus (Negri bodies). Measles virions \\r\\nwould be too small in comparison to the eukaryotic cells, so \\r\\nthe fused cells will not be measles virions. Macrophages are \\r\\nmononuclear cells.

Whereas active immunizations are a good idea for some pri-\\r\\nmary immunodefi ciencies, such as asplenia, this immuno-\\r\\ndefi ciency (XHIM) will interfere with his ability to respond \\r\\nto the injected antigens. Without T-cell communication, as \\r\\nmediated by CD40:CD40 ligand interaction, he is unable \\r\\nto generate appropriate antibody isotypes and  cannot gen-\\r\\nerate a memory response. It might also seem that prophy-\\r\\nlactic antibiotics would be warranted; however, they should \\r\\nbe avoided, because they increase the risk of infections with \\r\\nfungi or drug-resistant organisms. Injected IVIG will only \\r\\nprovide formed antibodies, which will degrade over time. He will need regular injections (usually every 3 to 4 weeks). Bone marrow transplantation for XHIM patients can be per-\\r\\nformed, which would permanently reconstitute the immune \\r\\nsystem with functional T cells. Bone marrow transplanta-\\r\\ntion is not without risks, so it is important to have an HLA-\\r\\nmatched donor (preferably a sibling), and the patient should \\r\\nbe in good condition prior to transplantation (young patient, \\r\\nwithout bronchiectasis or severe chronic infections). 1. Th   e answer is D [see 57.V.A.3.c]. B cells from XHIM patients are functionally normal;  however, \\r\\ntheir T cells lack a ligand necessary for the communication \\r\\nbetween the T cell and the B cell. T-cell communication is re-\\r\\nquired for isotype switching and memory cell diff erentiation. Without this interaction, T-cell and B-cell interaction in the \\r\\nlymph node does not occur, and the germinal centers do not \\r\\ndevelop. Th  e CD40 ligand is also important for activation of \\r\\nmacrophages. Macrophages and the cytokines that they pro-\\r\\nduce are also important for immune function. 2. Th   e answer is A [see 57.X.B.1.b]. IVIG and IGIM are both produced from pooled human sera. Both formulations are mostly IgG. 3. Th   e answer is B [see 57.IV.F.2.c]. In the last trimester of a pregnancy, maternal IgG is  actively \\r\\ntransported via FcRn receptors across the placenta into \\r\\nthe developing fetus. At birth the infant will have the IgG \\r\\n antibody  profi le of the mother, and these passively acquired \\r\\n antibodies provide antibody protection for the infant, until \\r\\nthe baby is able to make antibodies for himself.

Th   e answer is B [20.VIII.C.1.a]. Th  e painful area on JD’s left  foot is most likely a hard corn. Hard corns appear on areas over bony protrusions, such as \\r\\nthe tops of toes or the bottom of the foot, and possess a glossy \\r\\nappearance with a cone-shaped center. 6. Th   e answer is C [20.VIII.D.1.a]. Patients with corns and calluses may be instructed to soak \\r\\nthe aff ected foot in warm water for at least 5 minutes every \\r\\nday, which helps to loosen dead skin. Although fi les  and \\r\\npumice stones may be used with great caution to remove \\r\\nthe dead skin, any tool with a sharp blade (such as a razor) \\r\\nshould be avoided altogether. 1. Th   e answer is A [20.V.D.2]. All of these agents would be considered appropriate treat-\\r\\nment options for patients with dry skin except for cytostatic \\r\\nagents, which do not have a role in dry skin therapy. 2. Th   e answer is A [20.II.C.1]. Th e most likely diagnosis of JD’s condition is dandruff , \\r\\nwhich is primarily characterized by dry white/gray “fl akes” \\r\\nscattered across the scalp. Dandruff  is more severe in cooler \\r\\nmonths and less severe during summer months. 3. Th   e answer is A [20.II.C.2.b.(4).(a)]. Th  e active ingredient in Neutrogena T/Gel is coal tar, which \\r\\nis an appropriate fi rst-line recommendation for the self-\\r\\ntreatment of dandruff . 4. Th   e answer is C [20.II.C.2.b.(4).(a)]. Important counseling points regarding the use of coal tar \\r\\nproducts include the following: may cause photosensitivity \\r\\nand  folliculitis, and use on or near the groin, anus, and axil-\\r\\nlae should be avoided; can stain clothing and bedsheets, as \\r\\nwell as skin and hair (particularly blonde, gray, and bleached \\r\\nhair); possesses a strong, unpleasant odor; and should be used \\r\\nat least twice weekly for the fi rst 2 to 3 weeks of  treatment.

Th   e answer is A [see 27.I.D.4]. Oral syringes are the preferred means of measuring and \\r\\nadministering medications to infants. Th  e volume of most \\r\\ndoses given during the fi rst year of life are too small to be ac-\\r\\ncurately measured with a dosing spoon or cup. In addition, \\r\\nthe syringe allows placement of the medication between the \\r\\ncheek and gums, increasing the likelihood that the patient \\r\\nwill swallow the dose. Household measuring devices, includ-\\r\\ning those used for cooking, are oft en imprecise and can lead \\r\\nto over- or underdosing. 5. Th   e answer is D [see 27.I.B.2; 27.I.F]. Rectal acetaminophen is a useful alternative when oral ther-\\r\\napy is not tolerated. Neither aspirin nor the nonsteroidal \\r\\nanti-infl ammatory agents are appropriate for a 2-month-old. Aspirin has been associated with the development of Reye \\r\\nsyndrome in children and ibuprofen administration may \\r\\npredispose EF to renal impairment. 1. Th   e answer is A [see 27.I.D]. OTC products for infants and children should contain \\r\\n appropriate weight-based dosing recommendations. Acet-\\r\\naminophen dosing does not require calculation of BSA in \\r\\norder to provide a safe and eff ective dose. Th  e labeling infor-\\r\\nmation should also include recommendations for the length \\r\\nof therapy, the maximum daily dose, and adverse eff ect infor-\\r\\nmation, including guidelines for when medical care should \\r\\nbe sought immediately. 2. Th   e answer is B [see 27.I.B.2]. Th  e delay in acetaminophen absorption in early infancy is \\r\\nrelated to the delayed gastric emptying time seen in neo-\\r\\nnates, especially in those born prematurely. Acetaminophen \\r\\nabsorption is not signifi cantly aff ected by the higher gastric \\r\\npH, reduced bile salt and pancreatic enzyme production, the \\r\\nabsence of gut fl ora, or reduced intestinal metabolism. 3. Th   e answer is D [see 27.I.B.4]. During infancy, acetaminophen is primarily metabolized \\r\\nthrough sulfation. Sulfotransferases develop in utero and \\r\\nremain the predominant means of conjugation during the \\r\\nfi rst year of life.

Th   e answer is A [see 28.I.B.1–4]. Although it has been documented that advancing age does \\r\\ndecrease GI mobility and splanchnic blood fl ow; the clinical \\r\\nimpact which these changes occur do not result in signifi cant \\r\\nadjustments necessary for patients receiving orally adminis-\\r\\ntered drugs. 5. Th   e answer is C [see 28.I.D.1–5; Tab l e 28-2]. Oxazepam and lorazepam are dependent on phase II reac-\\r\\ntions for their inactivation by the liver. However, such reac-\\r\\ntions are not altered with advancing and therefore do not \\r\\ncreate potential issues in elderly patients. Each of the other \\r\\ngroups of drugs represent classes of drugs which either have \\r\\ndemonstrable exaggerated eff ects in the elderly (propranolol \\r\\nand methyldopa), are associated with a high degree of anti-\\r\\ncholinergic eff ects (amitriptyline, imipramine, hydroxyzine, \\r\\nand cyproheptadine), or are dependent on a  pharmacokinetic \\r\\nprocess, which is altered in the elderly population phase I \\r\\n reactions (diazepam, fl urazepam). 1. Th   e answer is D (II and III) [see 28.I.C.2; Tab l e 28.3]. Patient PO is demonstrating several of the routine eff ects of \\r\\nanticholinergic drugs when administered to patients. Unfor-\\r\\ntunately for patient PO, the anticholinergic eff ects of chlor-\\r\\npheniramine may very well have contributed to the routine \\r\\neff ects seen with the administration of agents possessing an-\\r\\nticholinergic properties. 2. Th   e answer is B (III) [see 28.I.C.2; Tab l e 28.3]. Ipratropium, although used in the treatment of broncho-\\r\\nspasm as an inhalational agent; its activity is due to its anti-\\r\\ncholinergic properties which can result in an additive eff ect \\r\\nin patient PO who is also receiving the antihistamine, chlor-\\r\\npheniramine, which possesses strong anticholinergic eff ects. 3. Th   e answer is C (I and II) [see 28.I.B.2–4]. Reductions in lean body mass, total body water, and serum \\r\\nalbumin concentrations results in changes in the manner \\r\\nin which drug disposition occurs in the elderly population. Additionally, documented reductions in renal blood fl ow \\r\\nwith advancing age results in a decrease in GFR as such a \\r\\n reduction will necessitate changes in renally eliminated \\r\\ndrugs. Phase II reaction pathways are not impacted with \\r\\nadvancing age and, therefore, agents such as oxazepam and \\r\\nlorazepam do not have altered dosing requirements in the \\r\\nelderly population.

Sometimes she loses urine with little warning, other times she only loses urine when she \\r\\nlaughs. She is most bothered by the sudden urge to go followed by the loss of urine. She’s also heard about the latest \\r\\nosteoporosis medicines through the media. She has a family history of severe osteoporosis and would like to start \\r\\ntherapy. She wants advice about her complaints and possibly medications to treat her primary symptoms. 1. What is the most eff ective therapy for her menopausal \\r\\nsymptoms?

She is most bothered by a sudden urge to urinate then \\r\\nlosing urine. All of the following agents are useful to \\r\\ntreat this type of incontinence except\\r\\n(A) tolterodine. (B) trospium. (C) solifenacin. (D) duloxetine. 5. Which of the following would be the best for her initial \\r\\nosteoporosis test? (A) a T score\\r\\n(B) a femur x-ray\\r\\n(C) a FRAX score\\r\\n(D) a heel ultrasound\\r\\n6.

Th   e answer is B [see 29.VI.C.3]. Many agents have been studied for the treatment of vasomotor \\r\\nsymptoms. Th   e selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) \\r\\nparoxetine and fl uoxetine and the serotonin–norepinephrine \\r\\nreuptake inhibitor (SNRI) venlafaxine are all more eff ective \\r\\nthan placebo as is gabapentin and methyldopa. Th e antide-\\r\\npressant bupropion has not been studied for this purpose. 1. Th   e answer is C [see 29.VI.C.2]. Menopause symptoms can be relieved most eff ectively  by \\r\\nreplacing the defi cient hormone, estrogen. Symptoms typi-\\r\\ncally resolve within the fi rst month of therapy. Phytoestro-\\r\\ngens, such as soy isofl avones, have not been shown to be \\r\\nmore  eff ective than placebo in studies. Venlafaxine is eff ec-\\r\\ntive and clonidine is also helpful in relieving hot fl ashes, but \\r\\nnot  other symptoms of menopause such as vaginal dryness. Black  cohosh can be helpful, but therapy should be limited to \\r\\nless than 6 months.

Th   e answer is D [see 29.V.E–G]. Her symptoms are best described as both stress incontinence \\r\\nand urge incontinence. Stress incontinence involves the loss \\r\\nof urine with increased intra-abdominal pressure. Urge in-\\r\\ncontinence can be described as a sudden sense of needing \\r\\nto void followed by the involuntary loss of urine. Treatment \\r\\nshould focus on whichever component is more bothersome \\r\\nto the woman. Overfl ow incontinence is uncommon in \\r\\nwomen. Th  is type of incontinence typically results in a con-\\r\\ntinuous loss of small amounts of urine. 4. Th   e answer is D [see 29.V.F.1.b.(1)]. Tolterodine, trospium, and solifenacin are all anticholinergic \\r\\nagents that will decrease bladder contractility, thus  improving \\r\\nurge incontinence. Duloxetine exerts its eff ect on the urethra \\r\\nwhich will be more helpful in stress incontinence. 5. Th   e answer is A [see 29.VII.C]. A T score is determined by a dual-energy x-ray absorptiom-\\r\\netry (DXA) scan. Th  e bone mineral density measurement \\r\\nfrom this scan is compared to that of a woman in her 30s. A T score less than \\u00062.5 is indicative of osteoporosis. A tra-\\r\\nditional x-ray can detect low bone mass only aft er 20% to \\r\\n30% loss. A FRAX score only predicts a woman’s likelihood \\r\\nof having a fracture in the next 10 years. It does not diagnose \\r\\nosteoporosis. A heel ultrasound is a great screening tool and \\r\\ncan have a T score assigned to the result, but this is not the \\r\\ngold standard nor is the measurement one of the two com-\\r\\nmonly used for the diagnosis of osteoporosis (hip and spine). 6. Th   e answer is B [see 29.VII.D; Tab l e 29-4]. Hip fractures have been shown to be reduced with estro-\\r\\ngen, bisphosphonate, teriparatide, and denosumab therapies. Calcitonin has been shown to reduce vertebral fractures but \\r\\nnot fractures elsewhere.

Th   e answer is B [see 30.VIII.B.1–2]. His phosphate level is elevated mainly as a result of his renal \\r\\nfailure. Th  is is the only laboratory abnormality he has that can \\r\\nbe managed with drug therapy. A non–calcium-based phos-\\r\\nphate binding agent could be initiated such as sevelamer. 4. Th   e answer is C [see 30.I.A–D]. Given the huge discrepancy in Dan’s lab values from the pre-\\r\\nvious 2 days without a change in his clinical status, the most \\r\\nlikely reasons related to some type of error either laboratory, \\r\\nreporting, or collecting of samples. Th e eff ect of his late din-\\r\\nner would be very unlikely to impact all of his morning labs. 5. Th   e answer is A [see 30.II.A.1–5]. Classic iron defi ciency anemia is characterized by a low \\r\\n hemoglobin, hematocrit, MCV, and RBC. Other specifi c \\r\\ntests including ferritin, serum iron, and total iron-binding \\r\\n capacity (TIBC) are abnormal as well. 1. Th   e answer is B [see 30.IV.B.1–4]. Although his BUN and SCr are signifi cantly elevated above \\r\\nnormal, they are consistent for a patient with end-stage  renal \\r\\ndisease who is not receiving hemodialysis. His sodium, chlo-\\r\\nride, and glucose values are normal. Potassium is signifi -\\r\\ncantly elevated putting him at risk for arrhythmias. His ECG \\r\\nchanges are consistent with hyperkalemia requiring urgent \\r\\nintervention to “protect”/stabilize his heart to the eff ects of \\r\\npotassium and to lower serum potassium values. 2. Th   e answer is C [see 30.VII.B.2–6]. Th e patient has severe hyperkalemia with ECG changes; \\r\\n therefore, he needs Ca gluconate to stabilize the heart and \\r\\naggressive intervention to lower the serum potassium levels \\r\\nwith a combination of a binding agent to remove potassium \\r\\nfrom the body (SPS) and an intervention to drive potassium \\r\\ninto the cells quickly (insulin and glucose).

Th   e answer is D [see 31.III.G.2.d]. Th  e most recent national guidelines for the treatment of \\r\\nSTEMI include the use of fi brinolytics within 30 minutes \\r\\nof hospital presentation, or primary percutaneous coro-\\r\\nnary  intervention (PCI) within 90 minutes of fi rst medical \\r\\nas part of the management of patients with STEMI. Addi-\\r\\ntionally, adjunctive therapies suggested for patients treated \\r\\nfor STEMI include the analgesic morphine, the antiplatelet \\r\\nclopidogrel, and a \\n-adrenergic blocker such as atenolol an \\r\\ninitial therapy in patients with STEMI. Eptifi batide, as a gly-\\r\\ncoprotein IIB/IIIA receptor blocker, is indicated for patients \\r\\nundergoing PCI. However, it is not considered as an initial \\r\\ntherapy in STEMI patients. 5. Th   e answer is E [see 31.III.G.2.d]. Th  e treatment of acute coronary syndrome provides specifi c \\r\\nguidelines for unstable angina (UA), STEMI, and non-ST \\r\\n elevated myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). A major diff er-\\r\\nence between the treatment of STEMI and NSTEMI is the \\r\\nindication for fi brinolytics such as reteplase in the acute \\r\\ntreatment of STEMI but, to date, not yet shown benefi t  in \\r\\npatients with NSTEMI. 1. Th   e answer is E (I, II, and III) [see 31.III.H.4.a.(3)]. Th  e most recently introduced guidelines for the treatment \\r\\nof STEMI patients include the use of \\n-adrenergic blocker \\r\\ntherapy, such as atenolol or metoprolol initiated within the \\r\\nfi rst 24 hours, assuming that there are no contraindica-\\r\\ntions for their use (heart failure, heart block, asthma, etc.). Additionally, aspirin continues to be a very important part \\r\\nof the initial therapy for STEMI patients. Th  e most recent \\r\\n guidelines provide a Class I recommendation for the admin-\\r\\nistration of aspirin as early as possible, pending no contrain-\\r\\ndications in a dose of 162 to 325 mg. 2. Th   e answer is A [see 31.III.H..4.a.(2).(a-c.)]. Tenecteplase is a fi brinolytic indicated in the treatment of \\r\\nSTEMI patients, and its major benefi t is the ease of admin-\\r\\nistration. For our patient, weight less than 60 kg, a single \\r\\nIV dose of 30 mg is used for treatment. Of the remaining \\r\\nchoices, only alteplase and reteplase are considered fi brino-\\r\\nlytic agents, with alteplase being given IV over 90 minutes as \\r\\na bolus followed by a 60-minute infusion; and reteplase given \\r\\nas two 10-unit IV doses 30 minutes apart from each other. 3. Th   e answer is A (I only) [see 31.II.H.5.c.(1)]. During recent years, concern has resulted in confl icting \\r\\nconcerns regarding the potential interaction between select \\r\\nproton pump inhibitors (PPIs) such as omeprazole and the \\r\\nantiplatelet agent clopidogrel.

Th   e answer is A (I) [see Tab l e 32-1]. Th  e Vaughan Williams classifi cation has been used to pro-\\r\\nvide a structure for placing antiarrhythmics into categories \\r\\nbased on the eff  ect which each drug has on the cardiac action \\r\\npotential. Currently, four classes of drugs are used (Class I, \\r\\nII, III, IV); with Class I agents broken down into three \\r\\n respective groups (Group Ia, Ib, Ic), based on specifi c actions \\r\\non the fast-channel sodium conduction. Choice I   accurately \\r\\nrepresents the Class III agents; choice II represents Class Ib \\r\\n(mexiletine and lidocaine) and Class Ic (fl ecainide) agents, \\r\\nand choice III represents Class II \\n-adrenergic receptor \\r\\nblockers (propranolol) and Class IV calcium-channel block-\\r\\ners (diltiazem) agents. 5. Th   e answer is B [see 32.I.C.3.a–d]. Torsades de pointes, from the French for “twisting of the \\r\\npoints,” continues to receive increased attention as a major \\r\\nproarrhythmic event, which has been reported with antiar-\\r\\nrhythmic drug therapy as well as nonantiarrhythmic therapy. Th  e attention has resulted in an ongoing list of a registry site \\r\\nwhere health care providers can add additional drugs, which \\r\\nhave demonstrated such eff  ects, as a way to try and minimize \\r\\nthe use of such agents, in combination. Currently, the reg-\\r\\nistry contains four categories of drugs based on the risk for \\r\\ntheir association with causing torsades. 1. Th   e answer is B (III) [see 32.II.C.4.b; 32.II.C.5.b]. Although sotalol is included in the Class III antiarrhythmics, \\r\\ndue to its eff ect to prolong the action potential, it still pos-\\r\\nsesses the attributes of other \\n-adrenergic receptor  blockers. In patient AM this is revealing itself through its negative \\r\\ninotropic eff ects, which is responsible for his dyspnea and \\r\\nneed for ramipril. A decision to discontinue the sotalol and \\r\\nemploy another agent for atrial fi  brillation might result in the \\r\\nability to remove the ramipril as well, depending on cardiac \\r\\nstatus. Th e fi rst step would be to stop the sotalol and evalu-\\r\\nate cardiac response while initiating another agent for atrial \\r\\nfi brillation. 2. Th   e answer is D [see 32.II.A.4.g; 32.II.C.1.d; 32.II.E.5.b]. Each of the agents has received a recommendation in \\r\\nthe  treatment of atrial fi brillation. However, only dofetilide \\r\\n(Tikosyn) would be a suitable alternative to sotalol in this \\r\\n patient who also suff ers from heart failure, and does not pos-\\r\\nsess the concerns demonstrated with the other agents for \\r\\npatients with heart failure. Th  e recent focused guidelines \\r\\nalgorithm includes dofetilide for those patients with atrial \\r\\nfi brillation accompanied by heart failure. Th  e negative ino-\\r\\ntropic eff ects associated with each of the other agents listed \\r\\nmake them not useful in such patients. 3. Th   e answer is C (I and II) [see 32.II.C.3.a]. Amiodarone has been indicated for treatment of various \\r\\narrhythmias, including the ventricular arrhythmias as well \\r\\nas atrial and supraventricular arrhythmias. With various \\r\\n indications, various regimens for maximizing the adminis-\\r\\ntration of amiodarone to patients have appeared. However, \\r\\nmany diff erent regimens have been recommended, based on \\r\\nsuch indications. For atrial fi brillation, which is an unlabeled \\r\\nindication for amiodarone, several recommendations have \\r\\nbeen made that provide the drug in a less than “emergency” \\r\\nmanner through the slow administration titration of the \\r\\ndrug over a period of weeks to months—as compared to the \\r\\ntreatment of serious ventricular tachycardias, where the goal \\r\\nis to administer larger amounts of drug over a shorter time \\r\\nperiod in order to correct an emergency critical situation.

Th   e answer is C [see 33.III.B.8.b]. Recognizing the successes which have been described \\r\\nwith the use of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor \\r\\n blockers (ARBs) in the treatment of hypertension, the ability \\r\\nto directly inhibit the enzyme responsible for producing the \\r\\nend product angiotensin II would appear to be a good step in \\r\\nthe eff ective treatment of hypertension. Because angiotensin \\r\\nII acts as a potent vasoconstrictor as well as stimulator for the \\r\\nsubsequent release of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex, it \\r\\nwould appear that the inhibition of the enzyme responsible \\r\\nfor that would add value in the treatment of hypertension. Currently, there is one single entity product on the market \\r\\nwith aliskiren; however, to date, additional combination \\r\\nproducts have already been marketed with other therapeutic \\r\\ncategories used in the treatment of hypertension. 5. Th   e answer is E (I, II, and III) [see Tab l e 33-5]. Substantial attention has focused on the development of \\r\\ncombination products during the last few years. Referred to \\r\\nas super pills, the products contain diff erent types of drugs, \\r\\nwhich are indicated for diff ering types of diseases as well as \\r\\ncombinations of drugs used to treat a single disease state, \\r\\nsuch as hypertension. Each of the responses represents a \\r\\ncombination of three separate drugs with diff erent antihy-\\r\\npertensive treatment classes in one tablet, with the goal being \\r\\nto improve patient compliance. Th  e three drugs included in \\r\\neach product contain the following:\\r\\n(A)  Amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide (Exforge HCT): \\r\\nCCB, ARB, thiazide diuretic\\r\\n(B)  Amlodipine/olmesartan/hydrochlorothiazide (Tribenzor): \\r\\nCCB, ARB, thiazide diuretic\\r\\n(C)  Aliskiren/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide (Amturnide): \\r\\nrenin inhibitor, CCB, thiazide diuretic\\r\\n1. Th   e answer is C [see Tab l e 33-1]. “Prehypertension” was a newly introduced category into the \\r\\nmost recent JNC-7 treatment guidelines, and represents an \\r\\nintent to deal with predisposing lifestyle factors, which play \\r\\na part in the future development of hypertension in such \\r\\n patients. Th  e guideline assumes that by treating those fac-\\r\\ntors which can be altered in patients who are predisposed \\r\\nto  hypertension that hypertension can be avoided. Currently, \\r\\nthe recommendation does not include drug therapy; unless \\r\\nthe patient has a compelling reason for doing so. 2. Th   e answer is B [see Tab l e 33-1; Tab l e 33-2]. Th  e JNC-7 report provides a listing of six clinical entities, \\r\\nwhich are recognized as signifi cant enough in the lives of \\r\\nhypertensive patients, that their therapy needs to be highly \\r\\nprioritized in patients presenting with one of them. Clini-\\r\\ncal entities such as heart failure, post-myocardial infarction \\r\\n(MI), high coronary artery risk history, chronic kidney fail-\\r\\nure, diabetes mellitus, and recurrent stroke prevention have \\r\\nbeen included in the list of designated compelling issues. Each issue has a group or groups of selected drugs for treat-\\r\\nment, which are then added to the specifi c regimen for such \\r\\npatients. Obesity is a modifi able risk factor for hypertension, \\r\\nbut by itself is not considered a compelling issue needing \\r\\n select treatment in a hypertensive patient. 3. Th   e answer is E [see Tab l e 33-1]. Th  e added information regarding the patient’s strong fam-\\r\\nily history of cardiovascular events would suggest a compel-\\r\\nling reason to initiate therapy for “prehypertension. ” In this \\r\\ncase with the use of diuretics, ACE inhibitors, \\n-adrenergic \\r\\nblockers, and calcium-channel blockers (CCBs) such as \\r\\n chlorothiazide, ramipril, carvedilol, and felodipine would \\r\\nbe consistent with the guidelines based on a  “high-risk \\r\\n cardiovascular lifestyle”; however, prazosin, a peripheral \\r\\n\\u000b1 adrenergic blocker, is not considered an initial therapy \\r\\nfor hypertension and would not be used in this patient at \\r\\nthis time.

Th   e answer is A (I only) [see 34.I.F.1–2; Fig. 34-1]. Patients do not routinely present with either left -sided  or \\r\\nright-sided heart failure but the terms are useful in helping to \\r\\nidentify which side of the heart is responsible for the respec-\\r\\ntive signs and symptoms which patients present with. In the \\r\\ncurrent patient, EL, signs suggestive of left  -sided heart failure \\r\\ninclude the pulmonary signs of shortness of breath, fatigue, \\r\\nand orthopnea—based on the number of pillows necessary \\r\\nwhen in the reclining position. Th  is is in comparison to \\r\\nright-sided fi ndings which would refl ect peripheral edema, \\r\\nresulting in pedal edema, jugular venous distension, a posi-\\r\\ntive hepatojugular refl ux, etc. It is also clear that this patient \\r\\ndoes not have high-output failure, where one would expect \\r\\nthe patient to have normal or high ejection fractions, as well \\r\\nas tachycardia (fi ndings that are consistent with anemias, \\r\\n hyperthyroidism,  etc.). 4. Th   e answer is B [see 34.I.G.4.c]. A Class I, Level A recommendation is the best recommen-\\r\\ndation one can receive for any given treatment/intervention, \\r\\nbased on the grading criteria used by the respective Ameri-\\r\\ncan Cardiology Associations. Such a recommendation would \\r\\nfavorably recommend its use based on the benefi t far exceed-\\r\\ning the risk for use, and the level of evidence available dem-\\r\\nonstrating such benefi t. 5. Th   e answer is B [see 34.IV. I.1–3]. Digoxin continues to fi  nd routine usefulness in the heart fail-\\r\\nure patient population, despite the level of evidence, which \\r\\nappears to be shift ing away from its routine usage. It has \\r\\nbeen used for its inotropic eff ects, despite the potential for \\r\\nsignifi cant side eff ects upon its use. Th erapeutic monitoring \\r\\nfor changes in renal function, altered fl uid, and electrolytes \\r\\nwill maximize the therapeutic eff ects while minimizing the \\r\\nside eff ects associated with its use. 1. Th  e answer is E (I, II, and III) [see 34.IV.F.5–6; 34.IV.J;\\r\\n34.I.F.3.e]. Patient EL has been treated for hypertension with a combi-\\r\\nnation of CCB (diltiazem) and \\n-adrenergic receptor blocker \\r\\n(bisoprolol). Although these agents in combination might be \\r\\nhelpful in the treatment of hypertension, they are not rou-\\r\\ntinely suggested as initial therapy in the JNC-7 guidelines. CCBs and \\n-adrenergic receptor blockers are not considered \\r\\ninitial therapy for hypertension unless the patient has a com-\\r\\npelling issue, which might warrant the use of such agents. Th  is, owing to the negative inotropic eff ects of the combi-\\r\\nnation, has a resultant ability to cause drug-induced heart \\r\\nfailure. Additionally, long-standing hypertension is a major \\r\\ncause for heart failure in many patients. 2. Th   e answer is C (I and II) [see Tab l e 34-4]. As it appears, the combination of diltiazem and bisoprolol \\r\\nhave put the patient in a heart failure state, without adequate \\r\\nreduction in blood pressure it would appear necessary to al-\\r\\nternate the therapy, based on national guidelines. Th is would \\r\\nresult in a discontinuation in both the bisoprolol and diltia-\\r\\nzem. However, remember to slowly titrate the patient off  of \\r\\nthe \\n-blocker. Additionally, as per the JNC-7 guidelines, a \\r\\nthiazide diuretic would be considered the initial treatment \\r\\nfor this patient. As there appear to be no compelling issues \\r\\nfor using other therapies instead of a \\n-blocker, the thia-\\r\\nzide diuretic should be the only agent added to this patient’s \\r\\nregimen. As the patient might be experiencing drug-induced \\r\\nheart failure, this might become a compelling reason to initi-\\r\\nate therapy with an ACE inhibitor or ARB, if no adequate \\r\\nresponse from the diuretic.

Th  e routine monitoring of the INR or aPTT is not necessary \\r\\nfor either the oral direct Factor Xa inhibitor or the oral direct \\r\\nFactor IIa (thrombin) inhibitor, which is considered a conve-\\r\\nnience relative to the requisite monitoring of the oral vitamin \\r\\nK antagonist (warfarin). 1.

At present time, there are two FDA approved alternatives to \\r\\nwarfarin to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism \\r\\nin patients with nonvalvular atrial fi brillation. Th  e oral direct \\r\\nFactor IIa (thrombin) inhibitor [dabigatran] and the oral di-\\r\\nrect Factor Xa inhibitor [rivaroxaban]. With respect to safety, \\r\\ndabigatran has been demonstrated to statistically signifi -\\r\\ncantly reduce the likelihood of intracranial hemorrhage, life-\\r\\nthreatening bleeding, and any bleeding when compared to \\r\\nwarfarin. Th  ere was a statistically signifi cant increase for the \\r\\npotential of major gastrointestinal bleeding—favoring warfa-\\r\\nrin. Major bleeding event rates were comparable between the \\r\\ntwo drugs (dabigatran and warfarin). For  rivaroxaban—there \\r\\nwas demonstrated non-inferiority to warfarin for prevention \\r\\nof stroke in the setting of nonvalvular atrial fi brillation with \\r\\ncomparable rates of major bleeding when comparing rivar-\\r\\noxaban to warfarin.

Th   e answer is C [see 36.VII.C.4.b.(3).(a)]. Tenofovir and emtricitabine may be dosed at any time of day, \\r\\nwithout regard to meals. Efavirenz should be dosed on an \\r\\nempty stomach at bedtime to permit optimal absorption and \\r\\nminimization of adverse eff ects. 2. Th   e answer is B [see 36.VII.C.4.b.(2)].

Th  e other combination products \\r\\nlisted are NRTI-only combinations. 3. Th   e answer is C [see 36.VII.C.4.b.(3).(a)]. Efavirenz causes central nervous system (CNS) adverse \\r\\n eff ects in approximately 52% of patients who take it. Typi-\\r\\ncally, patients experience dizziness, drowsiness, and vivid \\r\\nnightmares. Tenofovir and emtricitabine do not cause CNS \\r\\nadverse eff ects. Answers to Case 15\\r\\n4. Th   e answer is D [see 36.VII.C.4; Table 36-6]. NNRTIs are metabolized through the liver and require cau-\\r\\ntious use in hepatic dysfunction. In this case, the NNRTIs \\r\\n(nevirapine, etravirine, delavirdine) should be avoided due to \\r\\nthe patient’s elevated liver function tests (LFTs). Th e  patient \\r\\nshould receive a protease inhibitor (PI) or an integrase in-\\r\\nhibitor in place of the efavirenz. Addition of lamivudine is \\r\\nnot an option, as it is an NRTI. Raltegravir is the appropriate \\r\\nagent to use in this situation. 5. Th   e answer is A [see Tab l e 36-6]. Th  e preferred regimen for pregnant patients is lopinavir/\\r\\nritonavir plus zidovudine and lamivudine, as each of these \\r\\nagents have the most clinical data for use in pregnancy. Efavirenz should be avoided in pregnancy due to its terato-\\r\\ngenic potential.

Th  e recommended dose in a \\r\\nnonmanic patient is 5 to 10 mg/kg/day. 2. Th   e answer is A [see 40.II.D.b.3.a]. A VPA level can be drawn 3 to 5 days aft er starting VPA. Using a loading dose strategy allows for VPA to reach steady \\r\\nstate quicker than in a nonloaded patient. Th  erefore, you can \\r\\ndraw a VPA level at day 3. 3. Th   e answer is B [see 40.II.D.h]. Benzodiazepines, which lorazepam is, are useful in the short \\r\\nterm because they help in treating agitation and insomnia. Because benzodiazepines are not eff  ective in the treatment of \\r\\nbipolar disorder, they should be stopped once the patient is \\r\\nno longer acutely manic or experiencing symptoms of agita-\\r\\ntion or insomnia.

Th   e answer is C [see 32.II.B.4.a.(1); 41.I.I.1.f.(8).(b)]. -Adrenergic blockers, especially selective agents, have been \\r\\nshown to improve cardiovascular mortality in COPD. Selec-\\r\\ntive \\n-blockers can be used in asthma, but should be admin-\\r\\nistered cautiously, such as in a controlled environment (e.g., \\r\\nhospital) and in patients where mortality benefi ts outweigh \\r\\nthe risk of worsened bronchospasm. 4. Th   e answer is B [see 41.I.I.2.d.(1).(a)]. Systemic steroids routinely increase blood glucose within \\r\\n24 hours in patients with diabetes mellitus. 5. Th   e answer is D [see 41.II.G.2.e]. Brief interventions such as (A) or (B) are less eff ective than \\r\\nmore intensive counseling. Addition of drug therapy and \\r\\n intensive counseling has highest probability of cessation. 1. Th   e answer is B [see 41.II.G.1.d.(3).(d).(ii)]. Ipratropium and tiotropium should not be administered con-\\r\\ncomitantly due to increased anticholinergic ADRs and little \\r\\nadditive bronchodilation when combined. As  tiotropium is \\r\\na more potent bronchodilator in COPD, preferable to stop \\r\\nipratropium. 2. Th   e answer is B [see 41.II.G.1.h.(2).(f)]. ICS are well documented to decrease COPD exacerbations in \\r\\ncombination with long-acting \\n-agonists. ICS should not be \\r\\nused without long-acting \\n2-agonists in COPD (in contrast \\r\\nto asthma, where ICS can be used as monotherapy). Th eoph-\\r\\nylline is unsafe due to CAD.

Glucosamine acts as a substrate for and promotes the synthe-\\r\\nsis of glycosaminoglycans, which is essential for the extracel-\\r\\nlular matrix in cartilage. 4. Th   e answer is E [see 42.III.A]. Osteoarthritis is not considered a disease of infl ammation. Although there are times of minor infl ammation (e.g., OA \\r\\nfl are), it is localized to the aff ected joint(s). 1.

Th   e answer is A [see 43.IV.C.3.b.(1)]. Th  is most common dose of 300 mg/day is oft en inadequate. Th  e drug can be given in daily doses up to 800 mg/day. Th  e drug can be dosed once daily (long acting oxypurinol \\r\\n metabolite), it can be used for both overproducers or under-\\r\\nexcretors, it is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor (not a uricosuric), \\r\\nand plenty of fl uids are only warranted for the uricosuric, \\r\\nprobenecid. 5. Th   e answer is C [see 43.IV.C.1]. Beer can increase the serum uric acid level. Meat and fi sh \\r\\nhave high levels of purines which can elevate the serum uric \\r\\nacid, so decreasing these in the diet will likely decrease the se-\\r\\nrum uric acid. Weight loss decreases the serum uric. Taking \\r\\nagents that have uricosuric activity (vitamin C) will decrease \\r\\nthe serum uric acid level and using low-fat milk as a source \\r\\nof dietary protein is a good approach and will have a positive \\r\\neff ect on lowering his serum uric acid level. 1. Th   e answer is B [see 43.III.E.2.b]. NSAIDs are generally the fi rst-line agents, but will only be \\r\\nneeded for a few days, not 3 weeks. For (B), this is the new \\r\\neff ective dosage regimen for colchicine. Do not give any-\\r\\nthing (febuxostat) that would alter the serum uric acid as \\r\\nthis will likely prolong the attack. Take care of the patient’s \\r\\nacute  attack—we don’t care about the uric acid level initially. Can give oral indomethacin 50 mg tid, but then decrease the \\r\\ndose, don’t increase it. Th  e uric acid has been elevated prob-\\r\\nably for several months, but don’t worry about it, take care of \\r\\nthe patient’s pain—failing to start pain management as soon \\r\\nas possible will likely decrease the eff ectiveness of the pain \\r\\nmanagement therapy. 2. Th   e answer is B [see 43.I.B]. (A), (C), (D), and (E) are correct statements related to acute \\r\\ngouty arthritis. Gouty arthritis occurs most oft en in men \\r\\n(seven to nine times more oft en than women) and he is \\r\\n almost right at the usual age of onset. 3. Th   e answer is A [see 43.III.E.2]. Acetaminophen has no anti-infl ammatory properties and, \\r\\ntherefore, would not be useful in treating this patient’s acute \\r\\ngouty arthritis attack. Th  is agent is not included amongst \\r\\nthe specifi c agents to treat acute gouty arthritis. (B) through \\r\\n(E) are all correct statements. Answers to Case 20\\r\\n4. LN is begun on low-dose colchicine and then a month \\r\\nlater he is begun on allopurinol 100 mg/day to start. Four months later, he has yet another attack of acute \\r\\ngouty arthritis. He is on colchicine 0.6 mg once a day \\r\\nand allopurinol 300 mg/day. He has been on this dose \\r\\nfor 3 months and claims that he takes his medication \\r\\nregularly. His serum uric acid is 7.5 mg/dL. Which of \\r\\nthe following statements below best  describes a current \\r\\nimportant point about the use of allopurinol in the \\r\\ntreatment of hyperuricemia? (A) LN’s “standard 300 mg/day dose” is inadequate \\r\\nand should be increased. (B) It needs to be dosed three times daily in this \\r\\npatient. (C) It can only be used in patients who are \\r\\noverproducers of uric acid. (D) It is the only available uricosuric agent in the \\r\\nUnited States. (E) It should be taken with plenty of fl uid to prevent \\r\\nuric acid precipitation in the kidney. 5. LN follows his physician’s next therapeutic regimen \\r\\nwhich includes some counseling about his diet. All \\r\\nof the following will likely produce a decrease in the \\r\\n serum uric acid level which may prevent another \\r\\n attack for LN except:\\r\\n(A) cutting back some on red meat and fi sh.

Just prior to this visit, Ms. Torkey underwent a colonoscopy. Th  at exam revealed mucosal changes characteristic \\r\\nof moderate UC. Th  e extent of involvement included rectum and descending colon just below the splenic fl exure. Th  ere was no evidence of cancer or precancerous lesions. Ms. Torkey has no known medication allergies. Her current medications include loperamide up to 8 mg/day, \\r\\nacetaminophen up to 4 g/day, daily multivitamin with iron, amitriptyline 30 mg daily, and recently ibuprofen 200 \\r\\nmg up to six times daily as needed for joint pain, and diphenhydramine nightly for sleep.

Th   e answer is C [see 45.II.A.2; 45.II.A.3; 45.II.A.7]. No specifi c infectious agent has been identifi ed as a single \\r\\ncausative factor for UC. Use of broad-spectrum  antibiotics \\r\\nin UC is limited to fulminant disease or in patients with \\r\\ntoxic megacolon, where short-term use of antibiotics can \\r\\nbe  justifi ed due to the increased risk of perforation or bac-\\r\\nteremia. Use of select antibiotics with a goal of remission of \\r\\nacute IBD is controversial. Systemic corticosteroids as a rule \\r\\nare not accepted as long-term therapy due to risks of adverse \\r\\nevents and questionable therapeutic eff ect. Azathioprine has \\r\\nbeen useful as a long-term option. 5. Th   e answer is C [see 45.II.A.8]. Controlled trials of probiotic therapy in IBD have yet to \\r\\nclearly defi ne clinical utility. Th  ere is little evidence to sup-\\r\\nport their use in acute IBD. However, recent meta-analyses \\r\\nsuggest potential benefi t of probiotics, when combined with \\r\\nconventional therapies, for maintenance of UC but not \\r\\nCrohn disease. 1. Th   e answer is C [see 45.I.F.1.i]. Ibuprofen and other NSAIDs are the most commonly impli-\\r\\ncated class of drugs inducing IBD-like symptoms. Other \\r\\ndrugs implicated include gold compounds, oral contracep-\\r\\ntives, enteric potassium supplements, pancreatic enzymes, \\r\\nand phosphosoda bowel preps. 2. Th   e answer is B [see 45.II.B.2]. Patients with mild-to-moderate acute distal UC respond well \\r\\nto oral or topical 5-ASA (i.e., mesalamine). Topical 5-ASA \\r\\nplus oral 5-ASA is superior to either alone and may induce \\r\\nremission more quickly than either route alone. 3. Th   e answer is D [see 45.II.B.3.b]. Corticosteroids, topical or oral, are not eff ective in maintain-\\r\\ning remission of UC and should not be used. Data suggest \\r\\ntotal daily doses of 5-ASA less than 2 g are less eff ective than \\r\\ndoses greater than 2 g. Mesalamine 2.4 g/day is the proper \\r\\nchoice.

Th   e answer is C [see 46.I.B]. Th  e individual is at risk for T2DM because of his ethnic \\r\\norigin and his weight. Additionally, his islet cell antibodies \\r\\n(ICA) are negative, which further confi rms the suspicion of \\r\\nT2DM. Individuals with either LADA or T1DM typically \\r\\npresent with positive antibodies to insulin, glutamic acid de-\\r\\ncarboxylase, and/or pancreatic islet \\n cells. HHS is a form of \\r\\nhyperglycemic crisis that usually presents with blood glucose \\r\\nlevels greater than 600 mg/dL. 2. Th   e answer is A [see 46.VI.A.1.a]. Metformin, a biguanide, is the recommended initial agent \\r\\nfor the management of T2DM, unless contraindications \\r\\n(e.g., signifi cant renal or hepatic impairment, alcoholism, \\r\\nunstable heart failure) exist. A thiazolidinedione could be \\r\\ninitiated, but is not the preferred initial agent. At this time, \\r\\ninsulin is not indicated for long-term management of the \\r\\nblood glucose. 3. Th   e answer is C [see 46.X.A.1; X.C.1.a.(1)]. Neither the albumin to creatinine ratio, nor the triglyceride \\r\\nlevel is above goal.

Th   e answer is E [see 52.V.B.3]. Standard glucose system formulations (4.25% amino acid/25% \\r\\ndextrose) can generally be used in renal failure patients receiv-\\r\\ning hemodialysis or continuous replacement therapy (CRRT) \\r\\non a regular basis.

Th   e answer is B [see 40.VI.D]. Stimulant medications are recommended as fi rst-line treat-\\r\\nment because approximately 70% to 90% of patients will \\r\\nhave a symptom response. Stimulants have a larger eff ect size \\r\\nand a lower number needed to treat compared to nonstimu-\\r\\nlants. Although pemoline is a stimulant medication, its use \\r\\nhas fallen out of favor due to concerns over hepatotoxicity. 7. Th   e answer is D [see 40.VI.D.2.c]. A trial of two stimulants (one methylphenidate and one am-\\r\\nphetamine) is recommended as a fi rst-line treatment before \\r\\nswitching to a nonstimulant  medication. 8. Th   e answer is D [see 40.VI.D.3.a]. All of the choices are nonstimulant medications, but only \\r\\natomoxetine is FDA approved for adult ADHD. 9. Th   e answer is B [see Table 40-10]. Patients with evidence of clinical/laboratory evidence of \\r\\nliver injury is only contraindication listed to the use of \\r\\natomoxetine. 1. Th   e answer is B [see 40.IV.D.3.a.1]. Of the answers listed, fl uvoxamine is a fi rst-line  treatment \\r\\noption for OCD. 2. Th   e answer is D [see 40.IV.D.4.a]. Th  e use of antidepressants treatment in OCD is longer, 8 to \\r\\n12 weeks, compared to length of treatment with antidepres-\\r\\nsants used in order psychiatric illnesses, usually 4 to 8 weeks. 3. Th   e answer is B [see 40.IV.D.3.a.2]. Clomipramine is recommended only aft er a patient fails two \\r\\nto three trials of SSRIs. Clomipramine has been shown to be \\r\\nas eff  ective as the SSRIs; however, because of its adverse eff ect \\r\\nprofi le, it is recommended only aft er failure of SSRIs. 4. Th   e answer is A [see 40.IV.D.3.a.3]. Th  e starting dose of clomipramine is 25 mg. Th e maximum \\r\\ndose is 250 mg. 5. Th   e answer is C [see 40.IV.D.4.c].

(D) Benzodiazepine-receptor agonists off er \\r\\nno additional benefi ts compared to \\r\\nbenzodiazepines. 6. Th   e answer is A [see 40.VII.C.3.a]. Prescription medication for insomnia centers on the benzo-\\r\\ndiazepines and benzodiazepine-receptor agonists. Zolpidem \\r\\nis the only one listed that belongs to either of these two medi-\\r\\ncation classes. 7. Th   e answer is C [see 40.VII.C.3.c]. Ramelteon is a melatonin-receptor agonist  selectively target-\\r\\ning the melatonin receptors MT1 and MT2 loca ted in the hy-\\r\\npothalamus. Stimulating these receptors is thought to aff ect \\r\\nthe sleep–wake cycle and promote sleep. Th  is is the fi rst and \\r\\nonly agent in this medication class. 8. Th   e answer is A [see 40.VII.C.3.b.4]. Benzodiazepine-receptor agonists may have less rebound \\r\\ninsomnia, potential for abuse and dependence, hangover ef-\\r\\nfect, and rebound insomnia upon drug discontinuation com-\\r\\npared to nonselective  benzodiazepines. 9. Th   e answer is D [see 40.VII.E.1]. Benzodiazepines FDA approved for insomnia are all preg-\\r\\nnancy category X. 1. Th   e answer is A [see 40.VI.D.2.b]. Treatment with stimulants is started at the lowest possible \\r\\ndose and titrated slowly up to the maximal  tolerated dose. Initiation of therapy usually starts with an immediate-release \\r\\nstimulant and then changes to an extended-release agent to \\r\\nminimize the number of doses per day. 2. Th   e answer is C [see Table 40-9]. Th  e usual dosage range is 10 to 20 mg. 3. Th   e answer is D [see 40.VI.D.2.c]. A trial of two stimulants (one methylphenidate and one am-\\r\\nphetamine) is recommended as a fi rst-line treatment before \\r\\nswitching to a nonstimulant medication. 4. Th   e answer is C [see 40.VI.D.3.c]. Extended-release guanfacine works by inhibiting central \\r\\n release of norepinephrine and by increasing blood fl ow \\r\\nto the prefrontal cortex.

Th   e answer is D [see 18.III]. A patient’s blood pressure measured at home is typically \\r\\n5 mm Hg lower than when measured in the offi  ce. 2. Th   e answer is B [see 18.V.4]. Fertility microscopes allow women to determine their most \\r\\nfertile time of the month by the appearance of a  ferning \\r\\n pattern of their dried saliva. When estrogen levels rise with \\r\\npeak ovulation, there is an increase in the patient’s salt levels \\r\\nin the saliva, resulting in a fernlike pattern in dried saliva. 3. Th   e answer is E [see 18.III]. Th  e type of monitor to be selected or recommended should \\r\\nbe determined by the patient’s ability to use the product. In \\r\\nthis patient who lives alone and has dexterity issue, the most \\r\\nimportant factor to consider is the ability for the patient to \\r\\nuse the device with one hand. Selecting a monitoring device \\r\\nwhere the blood pressure cuff  has a D-ring would enable this \\r\\npatient to use the device independently. 4. Th   e answer is B [see 18.XI.B.2]. Th   e rectal temperature is 1°F higher and an axillary tempera-\\r\\nture is 1°F lower than an oral temperature. It is important \\r\\nwhen assessing a patient’s temperature to know the location \\r\\nit was taken (oral vs. rectal vs. axillary). 5. Th   e answer is E [see 18.I.B.2]. An axillary, Canadian or forearm, and quad crutch all re-\\r\\nquire the user to use their hands to grip the handle. A plat-\\r\\nform crutch is attached to the forearm with belts and does \\r\\nnot require the user to grip them with their hands. 6. Th   e answer is A [see 19.II.B.2.d(1)]. Th  e possibility of tooth discoloration may occur with the \\r\\ncontinuous use (2 to 3 months) of stannous fl uoride.

Vertigo should be treated under the care of a medical pro-\\r\\nvider. Ear candles are never an appropriate recommenda-\\r\\ntion and carbamide peroxide is used for ear wax removal, \\r\\nnot prevention of swimmer’s ear. Isopropyl alcohol 95% in \\r\\nanhydrous glycerin 5% is appropriate for the treatment of \\r\\nwater-clogged ears. 9. Th   e answer is C [see 19.III.A.7].

Th   e answer is D [see 21.III.F.3]. Nicotine gum is inappropriate for this patient because he has \\r\\ndentures. Th  e strength of the lozenge must be 4 mg because \\r\\nthe patient smokes within 30 minutes of waking in the morn-\\r\\ning.

Th   e answer is A [see 23.I.B.2]. Sodium phosphate is a saline laxative which should be \\r\\navoided in individuals with sodium restricted diets, such as \\r\\nindividuals with heart failure. Although docusate sodium \\r\\ncontains sodium, it is an insignifi cant amount and does not \\r\\nrequire caution with use in a person with heart failure. Senna \\r\\nand glycerin are both appropriate to use in persons with \\r\\nheart failure. 24. Th   e answer is A [see 23.II.C.2]. Loperamide is approved for those over the age of 6, where-\\r\\nas BSS is only approved for ages 12\\u0004 years for self-care. Lactase is only appropriate for individuals with a lactase \\r\\ndefi ciency, which is not demonstrated in this case. L. aci-\\r\\ndophilus is a probiotic, which may be recommended for \\r\\nmaintenance of normal gastrointestinal function, but is not \\r\\na prudent recommendation for treatment of acute, nonspe-\\r\\ncifi c diarrhea. 25. Th   e answer is B [see 23.II.C.2]. Self-care for diarrhea should be limited to 2 days with BSS or \\r\\nloperamide. Loperamide is approved for those \\u0002 6 years of \\r\\nage and prebiotics have no role in the management of diar-\\r\\nrhea. BSS may cause a harmless darkening of the tongue and \\r\\nstools. 26. Th   e answer is C [see 23.III.F.2]. At recommended doses, the risk of individuals receiving \\r\\nenough systemic absorption from hemorrhoidal vasocon-\\r\\nstrictors (phenylephrine) to develop cardiovascular or cen-\\r\\ntral nervous system eff ects is minimal; however, in those \\r\\nwith cardiovascular disease, anxiety disorders, or thyroid \\r\\ndisease, an agent that does not contain a vasoconstrictor is a \\r\\nprudent recommendation. 27. Th   e answer is C [see 24.III.B.7]. Levonorgestrel as emergency contraception is appropri-\\r\\nate for nonprescription purchase only for individuals ages \\r\\n17 and older. It is not appropriate to be used prior to inter-\\r\\ncourse, as it is not a method of birth control. It should be \\r\\nused within 72 hours of intercourse and is not eff ective once \\r\\nimplantation has occurred. 28. Th   e answer is B [see 24.I.B.1.d.(2)]. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the \\r\\ndrug of choice for dysmenorrhea. Acetaminophen lacks \\r\\nan effect on prostaglandins and thus would not be ap-\\r\\npropriate. Pamabrom is a diuretic and pyrilamine is an \\r\\n antihistamine. 16. Th   e answer is C [see 22.II.F.1.b]. All topical and oral decongestants should be used with ex-\\r\\ntreme caution in patients with disease states that are sensitive \\r\\nto adrenergic stimulation (e.g., type 1 diabetes, hypertension, \\r\\ndiffi  culty in urination owing to an enlarged prostate gland). Levmetamfetamine lacks vasopressor eff ects and can there-\\r\\nfore be used in such patients. 17. Th   e answer is B [see 22.III.E.2]. Pseudoephedrine and oxymetazoline are inappropriate rec-\\r\\nommendations because they treat nasal congestion. Saline \\r\\nnasal spray will only moisten the nasal passages for easier re-\\r\\nmoval of congestion. Diphenhydramine is a  fi rst- generation \\r\\nantihistamine and will likely cause signifi cant  sedation. Cetirizine is a second-generation antihistamine and will \\r\\nlikely treat the symptoms without signifi cant sedation. 18. Th   e answer is D [see 22.II.F.1; II.F.5; II.F.7]. Th  e only answer choice that is appropriate to recommend \\r\\nfor self-care for individuals less than the age of 2 is saline \\r\\nnasal spray. 19. Th   e answer is C [see 22.II.F.1; Table 22-1]. Likely, the sore throat the patient is experiencing is attribut-\\r\\nable to nasal drainage.

Th   e answer is D [see 24.III.B.1.b]. Th  e basal body temperature (BBT) should be taken in the \\r\\nmorning prior to arising from bed. Temperature can be tak-\\r\\nen orally, vaginally, or rectally, depending on the thermom-\\r\\neter purchased. A rise in temperature notes ovulation, thus \\r\\nthe fertile time period has passed. Changes in the BBT may \\r\\nbe due to infection, tension, a restless night, or any type of \\r\\nexcessive movement. 32. Th   e answer is A [see 24.III.B.3]. Lambskin condoms have pores which may allow the trans-\\r\\nmission of HIV or hepatitis B. 29. Th   e answer is D [see 24.II.A.4.d.(3)]. It typically takes 5 to 7 days for the symptoms of vulvovaginal \\r\\ncandidiasis (VVC) to resolve, despite treatment with a 1-, 3-, \\r\\nor 7-day course of therapy. Th  e 1- and 3-day treatments are \\r\\nfor convenience only and should not be misinterpreted as the \\r\\ntime to symptom resolution. If symptoms have not cleared \\r\\nup within 7 days, the woman should consult the care of a \\r\\nmedical professional. 30. Th   e answer is B [see 24.II.B.2–3]. Vaginal lubricants (e.g., K-Y INTRIGUE and Astroglide) are \\r\\nfor immediate relief of vaginal dryness and are mostly used \\r\\nprior to intercourse. Th  e vaginal dryness presented in this \\r\\npatient is chronic vaginal dryness. Th  us, a vaginal moistur-\\r\\nizer such as Replens would be more appropriate.

A prescription is usually written on a single sheet of paper \\r\\nthat is commonly imprinted with the prescriber’s name, \\r\\n address, and telephone number. A medication order is simi-\\r\\nlar to a prescription, but it is written on the patient chart and \\r\\nintended for use by a patient in an institutional setting. All prescriptions should contain accurate and appropri-\\r\\nate information about the patient and the medication that is \\r\\nbeing prescribed. In addition, a prescription order for a con-\\r\\ntrolled substance must contain the following information:\\r\\n1. Date of issue\\r\\n2. Full name and address of the patient\\r\\n3. Drug name, strength, dosage form, and quantity prescribed\\r\\n4. Directions for use\\r\\n5. Name, address, and Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) \\r\\nnumber of the prescriber\\r\\n6. Signature of the prescriber\\r\\nA written prescription order is required for substances listed \\r\\nin Schedule II. Prescriptions for controlled substances listed \\r\\nin Schedule II are never refi llable. Any other prescription \\r\\nthat has no indication of refi lls is not refi llable. Prescriptions for medications that are listed in Sched-\\r\\nules III, IV, and V may be issued either in writing or orally \\r\\nto the pharmacist. If authorized by the prescriber, these pre-\\r\\nscriptions may be refi lled up to fi ve times within 6 months \\r\\nof the date of issue. If the prescriber wishes the patient to \\r\\ncontinue to take the medication aft er 6 months or fi ve refi lls, \\r\\na new prescription order is required. THE PRESCRIPTION LABEL\\r\\nIn addition to the name of the patient, the pharmacy, and the \\r\\nprescriber, the prescription label should accurately identify \\r\\nthe medication and provide directions for its use. Prescription Dispensing Information \\r\\nand Metrology\\r\\nAppendix B\\r\\n*Th  e label of any drug that is listed as a controlled substance in Schedule II, III, or IV of the Controlled Substances Act must contain the following \\r\\nwarning: CAUTION: Federal law prohibits the transfer of this drug to any person other than the patient for whom it was prescribed. Th  e label for a prescription order for a controlled sub-\\r\\nstance must contain the following information:\\r\\n1. Name and address of the pharmacy\\r\\n2. Serial number assigned to the prescription by the pharmacy\\r\\n3. Date of the initial fi lling\\r\\n4. Name of the patient\\r\\n5. Name of the prescriber\\r\\n6. Directions for use\\r\\n7. Cautionary statements as required by law*\\r\\nAUXILIARY LABELS\\r\\nAuxiliary, or cautionary, labels provide additional important \\r\\ninformation about the proper use of the medication. Exam-\\r\\nples include “Shake Well” for suspensions or emulsions; “For \\r\\nExternal Use Only” for topical lotions, solutions, or creams; \\r\\nand “May Cause Drowsiness” for medications that depress \\r\\nthe central nervous system. Th  e information contained on \\r\\nauxiliary labels should be brought to the attention of the \\r\\npatient when the medication is dispensed. Th e pharmacist \\r\\nshould place only appropriate auxiliary labels on the pre-\\r\\nscription container because too many labels may confuse the \\r\\npatient. BEFORE DISPENSING THE \\r\\nPRESCRIPTION\\r\\nDouble-check the accuracy of the prescription. Provide undivided attention when fi  lling the prescription. 1. Check the patient information (e.g., name, address, date \\r\\nof birth, telephone number). 2. Check the patient profi  le (e.g., allergies, medical conditions, \\r\\nother drugs, including over-the-counter medications). 3. Check the drug (e.g., correct drug name, correct spelling, \\r\\nappropriate drug for the patient’s condition), and verify \\r\\nthat there are no known drug interactions. Always verify \\r\\nMutnick_AppB.indd   210Mutnick_AppB.indd   21007/10/12   2:40 PM07/10/12   2:40 PM\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"5b75c1e0-0f78-437a-8e9b-233f830a2e8f":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"5b75c1e0-0f78-437a-8e9b-233f830a2e8f\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"1LQ7+1zr90TAJSa9zA9juTYAcrsaz4Wsm2e5k74X54U=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"axvU7Aj1Go5WMOvdA1GjhwXSeHMTbkFalqnSueUY0JI=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"d511ffc6-21f2-499c-9d89-6e4123602fcd\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"4jIgYbEBKSRDCtOhFT1WdtoexDiIKn7m8kF/VNUBTNU=\"}},\"hash\":\"YKBloTNBQ1NfMJvr3pYJpQ+J9Gjce3A47+zEH1b4mks=\",\"text\":\"AppeAppendix B 211\\r\\nthe name of the drug.

Check the dosage, including the drug strength, the \\r\\n dosage form (e.g., capsule, liquid, modifi ed release), the \\r\\nindividual dose, the total daily dose, the duration of treat-\\r\\nment, and the units (e.g., mg, mL, tsp, tbsp). 5. Check the label. Compare the drug dispensed with the \\r\\nprescription. Verify the National Drug Code (NDC) \\r\\nnumber. Ensure that the information is accurate, that the \\r\\npatient directions are accurate and easily understood, \\r\\nand that the auxiliary labels are appropriate. 6. Provide patient counseling.

Detailed lists of these can be found \\r\\nat the websites of the Institute for Safe Medication  Practices \\r\\n(ISMP) and Joint Commission for the Accreditation of \\r\\nHealthcare Organizations (JCAHO) at :\\r\\nhttp://www.ismp.org/Tools/abbreviationslist.pdf. http://www.jcaho.org/accredited\\u0002organizations/patient\\u0002\\r\\nsafety/06_dnu_list.pdf. Th  e JCAHO has created a “Do Not Use” list of abbrevia-\\r\\ntions that its accredited organizations should not allow to \\r\\nbe used. • “U” or “IU” for units: the “U” has been misinterpreted \\r\\nas various numbers such as zero, four; serious harm has \\r\\n occurred with insulin and heparin as a result of confu-\\r\\nsion. For example, a patient received 66 units of insu-\\r\\nlin instead of 6 units. Th  e order was written for “6u” of \\r\\nregular insulin but was misinterpreted. Th  e word “units” \\r\\nshould be written out in full. • “QD, Q.D, qd, q.d.”: common abbreviations for daily \\r\\nhave been misinterpreted as “QID” or “qid” and overdoses \\r\\nhave  occurred. “Daily” should be written out in full. • “Q.O.D, QOD, qod”: common abbreviations for every \\r\\nother day have been misinterpreted as QID (four times \\r\\ndaily). Th  is should be written out completely as “every \\r\\nother day. ”\\r\\n• Trailing zero: when a dose is ordered and followed with \\r\\na decimal point and a zero, such as 2.0 mg or 25.0 mg, \\r\\nerrors can occur. Th  e decimal point may be missed and \\r\\nan overdose can occur. For example, Warfarin 2.0 mg \\r\\nmay be misinterpreted as 20 mg. Trailing zeros should be \\r\\n avoided and the dose written without the additional zero, \\r\\nfor  example Warfarin 2 mg rather than 2.0 mg. • Lack of leading zero: a drug’s dose may be less than 1 mg, \\r\\nsuch as Digoxin. Oft en the dose may be written without \\r\\na leading zero, such as Digoxin .25 mg, rather than as \\r\\nDigoxin 0.25 mg. Errors have occurred because the deci-\\r\\nmal point is missed. For example, Warfarin .5 mg may be \\r\\ninterpreted as Warfarin 5 mg. Leading zeroes should be \\r\\nincluded, so the dose is written as “Digoxin 0.25 mg or \\r\\nWarfarin 0.5 mg. ”\\r\\n• MS, MSO4, MgSO4: Abbreviations for morphine sul-\\r\\nfate (MS, MSO4) have been confused with Magnesium \\r\\nsulfate (MgSO4). It is recommend to write out each \\r\\nname in full rather than using abbreviations: morphine \\r\\nsulfate or magnesium sulfate. In addition to the above abbreviations, there are numer-\\r\\nous other hazardous symbols and abbreviations which \\r\\nshould be reviewed with caution when used on prescrip-\\r\\ntions.

Th  e kidneys normally help to keep blood \\r\\npotassium controlled, but in kidney disease or when certain \\r\\ndrugs are taken, dietary potassium must be limited to main-\\r\\ntain a normal level of potassium in the blood. Th e following \\r\\nguideline includes 2–3 g of potassium per day. Milk Group: Limit to one cup serving of milk or milk product \\r\\n(yogurt, cottage cheese, ice cream, pudding).

Th  e pharmacist likewise sells bulk packages of non-\\r\\nprescription drug and chemical items by the avoirdupois \\r\\nsystem. In contrast with the invariable use of  simple   quantities \\r\\nin the metric system, measurements in the common  systems \\r\\nare recorded whenever possible in  compound quantities   (i.e., \\r\\nquantities expressed in two or more denominations). So, 20 \\r\\nfǍ maybe used during the process of calculating but, as a \\r\\n fi nal result, it should be recorded as 1 pt 4 fǍ. Th  e process of \\r\\nreducing a quantity to a compound quantity beginning with \\r\\nthe highest possible denomination is called   simplifi cation . Decimal fractions may be used in calculation, but the subdi-\\r\\nvision of a minim or a grain in a fi nal result is recorded as a \\r\\n common fraction .

By selecting larger weight units to account for as many \\r\\nof the required grains as possible, beginning with the largest, \\r\\nwe fi nd that we may use following weights: \\r\\n \\u0002ii, \\u0002ss, ưss, 5 gr,  answer .

CLINICAL ASPECTS OF \\r\\nTHERMOMETRY \\r\\n Th  e instrument used to measure body temperature is termed \\r\\na  clinical  or  fever thermometer . Traditional clinical thermom-\\r\\neters include (1) the  oral thermometer , slender in the design of \\r\\nstem and bulb reservoir; (2) the  rectal thermometer ,   having  a \\r\\nblunt, pear-shaped, thick-bulb reservoir for both safety and to \\r\\nensure retention in the rectum; and (3)  a universal or security \\r\\nthermometer , which is stubby in  design, for both oral and rec-\\r\\ntal use. In addition,  oral  electronic digital fever  thermometers  \\r\\nand  infrared emission detection (IRED) ear thermometers   are \\r\\nwidely used. Th  e oral electronic digital fever thermometer \\r\\nworks by the absorption of heat from the point of body con-\\r\\ntact. Heat causes the expansion and rise of mercury in the \\r\\nthermometer and the response of the thermocouple. Th e \\r\\nIRED ear thermometer measures heat  radiated from the tym-\\r\\npanic membrane without actually  touching the membrane. A recent innovation is a thermometry system of  single-\\r\\nuse disposable  clinical thermometers that reduce the risk of \\r\\npassing harmful microorganisms between patients. 4    Th ese \\r\\ndisposable thermometers are commercially available in both \\r\\nnonsterile and sterile units. Th  e thermometers use a dot \\r\\n sensor matrix consisting of temperature-sensitive  indicating \\r\\ndots. Each dot changes color at a specifi c temperature rela-\\r\\ntive to the melting point of the specifi c chemical mixture \\r\\nin the dot. Each dot changes color at a temperature of 0.2°F \\r\\nor 0.1°C higher than the preceding dot. Body temperature \\r\\nis read from a numerical temperature scale. Clinically accu-\\r\\nrate oral body temperatures are obtained in 60 seconds and \\r\\n axillary temperatures in 3 minutes. Specialized thermometers include  basal thermometers  \\r\\nand  low-reading thermometers . Th e  basal    temperature  is the \\r\\nbody’s normal resting temperature, generally taken immedi-\\r\\nately on awakening in the morning. In women, body tem-\\r\\nperature normally rises slightly because of hormonal chang-\\r\\nes associated with ovulation. Basal thermometers, calibrated \\r\\nin tenths of a degree, are designed to measure these slight \\r\\nchanges in temperature. When charted over the course of a \\r\\nmonth, these changes are useful in assessing optimal times \\r\\nfor conception. Low-reading thermometers are required in  diagnosing \\r\\nhypothermia. Th e standard clinical thermometer reads \\r\\nfrom 34.4°C (94°F) to 42.2°C (108°F), which is not fully \\r\\n satisfactory for measuring hypothermia, which may involve \\r\\nbody temperatures of 35°C (95°F) or lower. A low-reading \\r\\n thermometer registers temperatures between 28.9°C (84°F) \\r\\nand 42.2°C (108°F). Examples of various thermometers are \\r\\nshown in Figure F-1. In the past, the  normal  body temperature for healthy \\r\\nadults was accepted to be 37°C (98.6°F) based on studies \\r\\n performed over a century ago. 5    Th  e use of advanced elec-\\r\\ntronic digital thermometers, however, has shown that nor-\\r\\nmal adult temperature may vary widely between individuals \\r\\n(from 96.3°F to 99.9°F in one study). 6  Lowest body temper-\\r\\natures generally occur in the early morning and peak high \\r\\ntemperatures in the late aft ernoon, with an average diurnal \\r\\nvariation of approximately 0.9°F. Pharmaceutical Aspects of Temperature \\r\\n Temperature control is an important consideration in the \\r\\nmanufacture, shipping, and storage of pharmaceutical \\r\\n products.

Alcohols of \\r\\n other percentage strengths are said to be  above  proof  or  below \\r\\nproof , depending on whether they contain more or less than \\r\\n50% v/v of absolute alcohol. Proof strength  is twice the percentage strength of  alcohol \\r\\nand thus 50% v/v alcohol is 100 proof. In reverse then, \\r\\n alcohol that is 90 proof is equivalent to 45% v/v alcohol. Alcohol for manufacturing use may be purchased by the \\r\\n proof gallon . A proof gallon is a gallon by measure of proof \\r\\nspirit; that is, a gallon of 100 proof or 50% v/v absolute  alcohol. Example Calculations Involving Proof \\r\\nStrength and Proof Gallons \\r\\n To calculate the number of proof gallons contained in a \\r\\ngiven quantity of alcohol of specifi ed strength, observe the \\r\\n following. Because a proof gallon has a percentage strength \\r\\nof 50% (v/v), the equivalent number of proof gallons may be \\r\\ncalculated by the formula: \\r\\nProof gallons \\u0002   gallons \\u0003 Percentage strength of solution    ____  50 (%)  \\r\\n Because proof strength is twice percentage strength, the \\r\\nformula may be revised as follows: \\r\\nProof gallons \\u0002   gallons \\u0003 Proof strength of solution   ___  100 (proof)  \\r\\n  How many proof gallons are contained in 5 gal of 75% v/v \\r\\nalcohol? First method:  \\r\\n 1 proof gallon  \\u0002  1 gallon of 50% v/v strength \\r\\n  5 (gallons) \\u0003 75 (%)  __  50 (%)   \\u0002 7.5 proof gallons, answer. Second method:  \\r\\n 75% v/v  \\u0002  150 proof \\r\\n  5 (gallons) \\u0003 150 (proof)  ___  100 (proof)   \\u0002 7.5 proof gallons, answer. To calculate the number of gallons of alcohol of speci-\\r\\nfi ed strength equivalent to a given number of proof gallons, \\r\\n observe the following: \\r\\ngallons \\u0002   Proof gallons \\u0003 50 (%)   ___   Percentage strength of solution  \\r\\n or, \\r\\ngallons \\u0002   Proof gallons \\u0003 100 (proof)   ___  Proof strength of solution  \\r\\n  How many gallons of 20% v/v alcohol would be the equiv-\\r\\nalent of 20 proof gallons? First method:  \\r\\n 1 proof gallon  \\u0002  1 wine gallon of 50% v/v strength \\r\\n  20 (proof gallons) \\u0003 50 (%)   ___  20 (%)   \\u0002 50 gal, answer. Second method:  \\r\\n 20% v/v  \\u0002  40 proof \\r\\n  20 (proof gallons) \\u0003 100 (proof)   ___  40 (proof)   \\u0002 50 gal, answer. To calculate the tax on a given quantity of alcohol of a speci-\\r\\nfi ed strength, observe the following: \\r\\n  If the tax on alcohol is quoted at $13.50 per proof gallon, \\r\\nhow much tax would be collected on 10 gal of alcohol marked \\r\\n190 proof ? 10 (gallons) \\u0003 190 (proof)  ___  100 (proof)   \\u0002 19 proof gallons\\r\\n$13.50 \\u0003 19 (proof gallons) \\u0002 $256.50, answer. Note: When specifi c equations, as those described above, \\r\\nare diffi  cult to recall, it is always an option to perform calcu-\\r\\nlations in a stepwise and logical fashion. Although a  greater \\r\\nnumber of steps may be required, the outcome is worth \\r\\nthe time. For example, in the above-stated problem, “ How many \\r\\nproof gallons are contained in 5 gal of 75% v/v alcohol? ”  If one \\r\\nworked logically on the basis of the amount of absolute \\r\\n alcohol in 5 gal of 75% v/v alcohol, the answer to the problem \\r\\nmay be deduced as follows: \\r\\n 5 gal  \\u0003  75% v/v  \\u0002  3.75 gal of absolute alcohol \\r\\n     (100% v/v) \\r\\n then, it follows that \\r\\n 3.75 gal of absolute alcohol  \\u0003  2  \\u0002  \\r\\n7.5 proof gallons,  answer . Th  e student may wish to work the same problem in \\r\\nterms  of milliliters (3785 mL/gallon) to arrive at the same \\r\\n answer.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"e7d167a9-e2ff-4766-af7c-272d004e2e81":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"e7d167a9-e2ff-4766-af7c-272d004e2e81\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"ATSt/J5gy7sMYemHKpuTTS2xKiIdqDrk2nJBbQ7QVbA=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"IAhgGIRZSCoXkNQjgEsFL1psGdpXx+DRdHqqnUVkJGI=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"b89d996b-18e4-47f0-8455-a0e99e4acba3\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"TWejVdDSlQZQbLvpfvQt4dk8WRXhdI0n+v3mKWdBDxI=\"}},\"hash\":\"mb/qYe1ZrdJKoDWPgdFp77uNgfbL/VwO5CvmU2oD0s8=\",\"text\":\"Mutnick_AppF.indd   289Mutnick_AppF.indd   28907/10/12   2:41 PM07/10/12   2:41 PM\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"ebff7d01-297b-4bb9-a2cd-6e174a4dd2aa":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"ebff7d01-297b-4bb9-a2cd-6e174a4dd2aa\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"P61br8tZeV/cLR6FFiAEePgAU14KfohcZte06wHW5iA=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"LOIh061VEvtkw8LXWMz83du66s4rSCR88NEw4wJJLM4=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"96f74ac0-b76a-4b27-8c5f-c8a27acff4e2\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"VqEgq1j6+R5Ynd70Q8cEl9zI+DmI3G+wm9fyPGqZuMw=\"}},\"hash\":\"75pUNKeyKIu1AcGekQenkpsyf5eZKHLofZnL+U4bgUc=\",\"text\":\"290 Appendix F\\r\\n Calculations of the Avoirdupois and \\r\\nApothecaries’ Systems \\r\\n  1.

Some aerosol emissions are intended to be \\r\\ninhaled deep into the lungs (inhalation aerosol), whereas \\r\\nothers are intended for topical application to the skin or to \\r\\nmucous membranes. Aerosols with metered valve assemblies \\r\\npermit a specifi c quantity of emission for dosage regulation. AROMATIC WATERS\\r\\nAromatic waters are clear, saturated solutions of volatile oils \\r\\nor other aromatic substances in water. Th  ey are used orally, \\r\\ntopically, or pharmaceutically for the characteristics of the \\r\\naromatic material they contain. BOLUSES\\r\\nBoluses are large elongated tablets intended for administra-\\r\\ntion to animals. CAPSULES\\r\\nCapsules are solid dosage forms in which one or more \\r\\n medicinal and/or inert substances are enclosed within small \\r\\nshells of gelatin. Capsule shells are produced in varying sizes, \\r\\nshapes, color, and hardness. Hard-shell capsules, which have \\r\\ntwo telescoping parts, are used in the manufacture of most \\r\\ncommercial capsule products and in the extemporaneous \\r\\nfi lling of prescriptions. Th  ey are fi lled with powder mixtures \\r\\nor granules. Soft -shell gelatin capsules are formed, fi lled, and sealed \\r\\nin a continuous process by specialized large-scale equipment. Th  ey may be fi lled with powders, semisolids, or liquids. Capsules contain a specifi  c quantity of fi  ll, with the capsule \\r\\nsize selected to accommodate that quantity. In  addition to their \\r\\nmedication content, capsules usually contain inert substances, \\r\\nsuch as fi llers. When swallowed, the gelatin capsule shell is \\r\\n dissolved by gastrointestinal fl uids, releasing the contents. Delayed-release capsules are prepared in such a manner \\r\\nas to resist the release of the contents until the capsules have \\r\\npassed through the stomach and into the intestines. Extended-release capsules are prepared in such a  manner \\r\\nas to release the medication from the capsules over an ex-\\r\\ntended period following ingestion. CREAMS\\r\\nCreams are semisolid preparations containing one or more \\r\\ndrug substances dissolved or dispersed in a suitable base. Many creams are either oil-in-water emulsions or aqueous \\r\\nmicrocrystalline dispersions in a water-washable base. Com-\\r\\npared to ointments, creams are easier to spread and remove. Creams are used for administering drugs to the skin and, to \\r\\na lesser extent, to mucous membranes. DRUG DELIVERY SYSTEMS\\r\\nDrug delivery systems are physical carriers used to deliver \\r\\nmedications to site-specifi c areas. Th  ey include transdermal, \\r\\nocular, and intrauterine systems. Transdermal drug delivery systems support the passage of \\r\\ndrug substances from the surface of the skin, through its var-\\r\\nious layers, and into the systemic circulation. Th ese  systems \\r\\nare sophisticated skin patches containing a drug formulation \\r\\nwithin a reservoir for the controlled delivery of drug. Ocular drug delivery systems consist of  drug-impregnated \\r\\nmembranes that, when placed in the lower conjunctival sac, \\r\\n release medication over an extended period. Intrauterine drug delivery systems consist of a drug- \\r\\ncontaining intrauterine device that releases medication over \\r\\nan extended period aft er insertion into the uterus. ELIXIRS\\r\\nElixirs are sweetened, fl avored, hydroalcoholic solutions \\r\\n intended for oral administration. Th  ey may be medicated or \\r\\nnonmedicated. Compared to syrups, elixirs are usually less \\r\\n*Some portions of this Glossary have been abstracted from the United States Pharmacopeia 31—National Formulary 26.

Special \\r\\ndevices are used to facilitate their administration. INJECTIONS\\r\\nInjections are sterile preparations intended for parenteral \\r\\nadministration by needle or pressure syringe. Drugs may \\r\\nbe injected into most any vessel or tissue of the body, but \\r\\nthe most common routes are intravenous (IV), intramus-\\r\\ncular (IM), and subcutaneous (SC). Injections may be \\r\\n solutions or suspensions of a drug substance in an aqueous \\r\\nor nonaqueous vehicle. They may be small-volume injec-\\r\\ntions, packaged in ampules for single-dose  administration, \\r\\nor vials for multiple-dose injections. Large-volume par-\\r\\nenterals, containing 100 mL to 1 L of fluid, are intended \\r\\nfor the slow intravenous  administration (or infusion) of \\r\\nmedications and/or nutrients in the institutional or home \\r\\ncare setting. IRRIGATIONS\\r\\nIrrigations are sterile solutions intended to bathe or fl ush \\r\\nopen wounds or body cavities. Th  ey are not intended for \\r\\n injection. LINIMENTS\\r\\nLiniments are alcoholic or oleaginous solutions, suspen-\\r\\nsions, or emulsions of medicinal agents intended for external \\r\\napplication to the skin, generally by rubbing. LOTIONS\\r\\nLotions are liquid preparations intended for external appli-\\r\\ncation to the skin. Th  ey are generally suspensions or emul-\\r\\nsions of dispersed solid or liquid materials in an aqueous \\r\\nvehicle. Th eir fl uidity allows rapid and uniform application \\r\\nover a wide skin surface. Lotions are intended to soft en the \\r\\nskin and leave a thin coat of their components on the skin’s \\r\\nsurface as they dry. LOZENGES\\r\\nLozenges are solid preparations containing one or more \\r\\nmedicinal agents in a fl avored, sweetened base intended to \\r\\n dissolve or disintegrate slowly in the mouth, releasing medi-\\r\\ncation generally for localized eff ects. MAGMAS\\r\\nMagmas are pharmaceutical suspensions of fi ne  particles \\r\\nthat, because of a high degree of physical attraction to the \\r\\naqueous vehicle, form a gelatinous mixture. Th is characteris-\\r\\ntic maintains the uniformity and stability of the suspension. Magmas are administered orally. sweet and less viscous because they contain a lesser amount \\r\\nof sugar. Because of their hydroalcoholic character, elixirs are \\r\\nbetter able than are syrups to maintain both water-soluble \\r\\nand alcohol-soluble components in solution. EMULSIONS\\r\\nAn emulsion is a type of dispersal system in which one liquid \\r\\nis dispersed throughout another liquid in the form of fi ne \\r\\ndroplets. Th  e two liquids, generally an oil and water, are im-\\r\\nmiscible and constitute two phases that would separate into \\r\\nlayers without the presence of a third agent, an emulsifi er \\r\\nor emulsifying agent. Th  e latter facilitates the emulsifi cation \\r\\nprocess and provides physical stability to the system. If oil is the internal phase, then the emulsion is termed an \\r\\noil-in-water, or o/w, emulsion. If water is the internal phase, \\r\\nthen the emulsion is termed a water-in-oil, or w/o, emulsion. Th  e type of emulsion produced is largely determined by the \\r\\nemulsifying agent, with hydrophilic agents generally produc-\\r\\ning oil-in-water emulsions and lipophilic agents generally \\r\\nproducing water-in-oil emulsions. Emulsifying agents may \\r\\nhave both hydrophilic and lipophilic characteristics, hence \\r\\nthe term hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB). Depending on their formulation, emulsions may be \\r\\n administered orally, topically, or by intravenous injection. EXTRACTS\\r\\nExtracts are concentrated preparations of vegetable or ani-\\r\\nmal drugs prepared by extracting the constituents from the \\r\\nnatural source and drying the extractive to the desired  pilular \\r\\nor powdered form. FLUID EXTRACTS\\r\\nFluid extracts are liquid extractives of vegetable drugs gener-\\r\\nally prepared such that 1 mL represents the active constitu-\\r\\nents from 1 g of the vegetable drug. GELS\\r\\nGels are semisolid systems consisting of either suspensions \\r\\nof small inorganic particles or large organic molecules inter-\\r\\npenetrated by a liquid. IMPLANTS OR PELLETS\\r\\nImplants or pellets are small, sterile, solid dosage forms con-\\r\\ntaining a concentrated drug for subcutaneous implantation \\r\\nin the body where they continuously release their medica-\\r\\ntion over prolonged periods.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"c0943eb0-41fa-47e2-abde-b485393957dd":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"c0943eb0-41fa-47e2-abde-b485393957dd\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"TfnBry5+ic90JX/WJWpAP/2Nl5IcKMGDFYPN0AcK3Jc=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"3FZg3bfj2l2sgSXgwT1K2AxPxlK8JTgrXBRqqQ6VLiU=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"2c852487-8eae-4199-9f44-301df4511039\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"gmsSDhNZBMhXH7bs8Z43FBCDrqBHeZhXW8DuM0Yxyq4=\"}},\"hash\":\"8dmFAl9XrPf9626An73czTLgRAVpOG07387OQqMKrMI=\",\"text\":\"INHALATIONS\\r\\nInhalations are fi nely powdered drug substances, solutions, \\r\\nor suspensions of drug substances administered by the nasal \\r\\nMutnick_AppG.indd   294Mutnick_AppG.indd   29407/10/12   2:41 PM07/10/12   2:41 PM\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"5215aebd-fc5d-4885-ae20-455ebd9bf9c3":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"5215aebd-fc5d-4885-ae20-455ebd9bf9c3\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"4KbH0vyErpM5rGNJCMP9xUVWZHM9ErHwCj+9+9sAWLQ=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"188iucUKMeEoZJvs8yCn0iaK8vs/bSTKjqNJfF5wL+A=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"ec81e60c-7d7b-41ad-8365-26151c002004\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"lB/eL07ERbPnuGwEbqEFbGmxWRtwqc5sBRHyU3QCPM8=\"}},\"hash\":\"Tl2nbTh2YvJH9e13DzeEricXF8bqlUJklwAGfbxr/hM=\",\"text\":\"Appendix G 295\\r\\nbe expressed in molar strength, milliequivalent strength, \\r\\npercentage strength, ratio strength, milligrams per milliliter, \\r\\nor another expression describing the amount of active ingre-\\r\\ndient per unit of volume. SPIRITS\\r\\nSpirits are alcoholic or hydroalcoholic solutions of volatile \\r\\nsubstances. Depending on their contents, some spirits are used \\r\\norally for medicinal purposes and others as fl avoring agents. SUPPOSITORIES\\r\\nSuppositories are solid dosage forms intended for insertion \\r\\ninto body orifi ces. Th ey are used rectally, vaginally, and, \\r\\n occasionally, urethrally. Suppositories are of various weights, \\r\\nsizes, and shapes, depending on their intended use. Various \\r\\ntypes of suppository bases are used as vehicles for the medi-\\r\\ncation, including cocoa butter (theobroma oil), glycerinated \\r\\ngelatin, polyethylene glycols, hydrogenated vegetable oils, \\r\\nand fatty acid esters of polyethylene glycol. Depending on the \\r\\nbase used, the suppository either soft ens, melts, or dissolves \\r\\naft  er insertion, releasing its medication for the  intended local \\r\\naction or for absorption and systemic eff ects. SUSPENSIONS\\r\\nSuspensions are preparations containing fi nely   divided, \\r\\n undissolved drug particles dispersed throughout a  liquid \\r\\n vehicle. Because the drug particles are not dissolved, suspen-\\r\\nsions assume a degree of opacity depending on the concen-\\r\\ntration and size of the suspended particles. Because  particles \\r\\ntend to settle when left  standing, suspensions should be \\r\\nshaken to redistribute any settled particles before use to \\r\\n ensure uniform dosing. Depending on their formulation, \\r\\nsuspensions are administered orally, by intramuscular injec-\\r\\ntion, and topically to the eye. SYRUPS\\r\\nSyrups are concentrated aqueous solutions of a sugar or \\r\\nsugar substitute. Syrups may be medicated or nonmedicated. Nonmedicated syrups are used as vehicles for medicinal sub-\\r\\nstances to be added later, either in the extemporaneous com-\\r\\npounding of prescriptions or in the preparation of a formula \\r\\nfor a medicated syrup. In addition to the sugar or sweetener, \\r\\nsyrups also contain fl avoring agents, colorants, cosolvents, \\r\\nand antimicrobial preservatives to prevent microbial growth. Syrups are administered orally for the therapeutic value of \\r\\nthe medicinal agent(s). TABLETS\\r\\nTablets are solid dosage forms containing one or more me-\\r\\ndicinal substances. Most tablets also contain added phar-\\r\\nmaceutical  ingredients, as diluents, disintegrants, colorants, \\r\\nOINTMENTS\\r\\nOintments are semisolid preparations intended for topical \\r\\napplication to the skin, eye, ear, or various mucous mem-\\r\\nbranes. With some exceptions, ointments are applied for \\r\\ntheir local eff  ects on the tissue membrane rather than for sys-\\r\\ntemic eff ects. Ophthalmic ointments are sterile preparations \\r\\nintended for application to the eye. Nonmedicated ointments serve as vehicles, or as ointment \\r\\nbases, in the preparation of medicated ointments. Because \\r\\nointments are semisolid preparations, they are prepared and \\r\\ndispensed on a weight basis. PASTES\\r\\nPastes are semisolid dosage forms that contain one or more \\r\\ndrug substances intended for topical application to the skin. Generally, pastes contain a higher proportion of solid mate-\\r\\nrials than do ointments and thus are more stiff , less greasy, \\r\\nand more absorptive of serous secretions. PLASTERS\\r\\nPlasters are solid or semisolid adhesive masses spread across \\r\\na suitable backing material and intended for external appli-\\r\\ncation to a part of the body for protection or for the medici-\\r\\nnal benefi t of added agents. POWDERS\\r\\nPowders are dry mixtures of fi nely divided medicinal and \\r\\nnonmedicinal agents intended for internal or external use. Powders may be dispensed in bulk form, or they may be \\r\\n divided into single-dosage units and packaged in folded \\r\\n papers or unit-of-use envelopes. PREMIXES\\r\\nPremixes are mixtures of one or more drug substances with \\r\\nsuitable vehicles intended for admixture to animal feed-\\r\\nstuff  s before administration. Th  ey are generally in powdered, \\r\\n pelletized, or granulated form. SOLUTIONS\\r\\nSolutions are liquid preparations that contain one or more \\r\\nchemical substances (solutes) dissolved in a solvent or mix-\\r\\nture of solvents.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"ec81e60c-7d7b-41ad-8365-26151c002004":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"ec81e60c-7d7b-41ad-8365-26151c002004\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"4KbH0vyErpM5rGNJCMP9xUVWZHM9ErHwCj+9+9sAWLQ=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"188iucUKMeEoZJvs8yCn0iaK8vs/bSTKjqNJfF5wL+A=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"5215aebd-fc5d-4885-ae20-455ebd9bf9c3\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"Tl2nbTh2YvJH9e13DzeEricXF8bqlUJklwAGfbxr/hM=\"}},\"hash\":\"lB/eL07ERbPnuGwEbqEFbGmxWRtwqc5sBRHyU3QCPM8=\",\"text\":\"Th  e most common solvent used in pharma-\\r\\nceuticals is water; however, alcohol, glycerin, and propylene \\r\\nglycol also are widely used as solvents or cosolvents.
