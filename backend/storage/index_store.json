Introduction\r\nThe autonomic nervous system (ANS) plays a pivotal role in maintaining homeosta-\r\nsis by modulating various vital processes, including heart rate, blood pressure, respira-\r\ntory rate, gastrointestinal motility, and glandular secretions [1]. Understanding the \r\npharmacology of the ANS is paramount in medicine, particularly in anesthesia and other \r\nacute medical specialities, as it allows healthcare professionals to manipulate autonomic \r\npathways effectively and achieve desirable clinical outcomes [2]. This chapter aims to \r\nprovide a comprehensive overview of ANS pharmacology, focusing on the sympathetic \r\n(SANS) and parasympathetic (PANS) divisions and their associated receptors. Understanding the receptor selectivity of pharmacological agents is paramount in \r\nachieving desired clinical outcomes. Many drugs exhibit selectivity for specific adrener-\r\ngic or cholinergic receptors, allowing for targeted modulation of the SANS and PANS [3].

Furthermore, pharmacists, physicians, intensivists, and medical students ben-\r\nefit from a comprehensive understanding of ANS pharmacology. By grasping the \r\ncomplexities of autonomic receptor modulation, healthcare professionals can make \r\ninformed decisions regarding drug selection, dosing, and potential adverse effects. This knowledge enhances patient safety and improves clinical outcomes across vari-\r\nous medical disciplines. 2. Pharmacology of the sympathetic nervous system\r\nThe SANS, often referred to as the “fight or flight” system, prepares the body \r\nfor physical exertion and stressful situations. The primary neurotransmitter in the \r\nSANS is norepinephrine (noradrenaline), which interacts with adrenergic receptors \r\nlocated throughout the body. These receptors are categorized into two main subtypes: α and β [1]. The α-adrenergic receptors are further divided into α-1 and α-2 subtypes. α-1 \r\nreceptors are predominantly located in blood vessels, leading to vasoconstriction \r\nwhen activated. This effect increases systemic vascular resistance, elevating blood \r\npressure. α-1 agonists such as phenylephrine find clinical utility in managing hypoten-\r\nsion during anesthesia. Conversely, α-1 antagonists like prazosin induce vasodilation \r\nand alleviate conditions such as benign prostatic hyperplasia and hypertension. α-2 \r\nreceptors are primarily located presynaptically in sympathetic nerve terminals, where \r\ntheir activation inhibits the release of norepinephrine, resulting in negative feedback \r\nregulation of sympathetic outflow. Clonidine, an α-2 agonist, is commonly used in \r\nanesthesia and surgery to attenuate sympathetic responses, promote sedation, and \r\nenhance perioperative analgesia [1]. β-adrenergic receptors consist of three subtypes: β-1, β-2, and β-3. β-1 receptors \r\nare predominantly found in the heart, activating heart rate and contractility [1]. β-1 \r\nagonists like dobutamine enhance cardiac output in patients with heart failure or \r\ncardiogenic shock. β-1 antagonists, such as metoprolol, are widely used in to mitigate \r\nthe adverse effects of excessive sympathetic stimulation on the cardiovascular system \r\n[3]. β-2 receptors are abundant in the bronchial smooth muscle and peripheral vascu-\r\nlature, leading to bronchodilation and vasodilation when stimulated [1]. β-2 agonists \r\nlike salbutamol are commonly utilized to manage asthma and chronic obstructive \r\npulmonary disease (COPD) [3]. Conversely, β-2 antagonists may be used in conditions like glaucoma, where \r\nreduced intraocular pressure is desirable [3]. β-3 receptors are primarily present in \r\nadipose tissue, where their activation promotes lipolysis. While the therapeutic sig-\r\nnificance of β-3 receptors is still being explored, their modulation may hold potential \r\nin treating obesity and metabolic disorders. 2.1 Sympathomimetics2.1.1 α-1 receptor agonists\r\nα-1 receptors dominate most of the smooth muscle of the autonomic target \r\norgans.

Drugs that mimic the action of epinephrine and norepinephrine can \r\nbe called sympathomimetics. These drugs can be divided into direct and indirect \r\nagonists [4]. Direct agonists interact with the adrenoreceptor directly and subsequently \r\nactivate them, while indirect agonists depend on their ability to enhance the effect \r\nof endogenous catecholamines. The indirect agonist can do so by (i) displacing \r\ncatecholamine from their adrenergic nerve endings and inducing their release (e.g., \r\nthe mechanism of action of tyramine), (ii) inhibiting the clearance of catechol-\r\namines by decreasing their neuronal reuptake (e.g., the mechanism of action of \r\ncocaine and tricyclic antidepressants), or (iii) preventing the enzymatic metabo-\r\nlism of norepinephrine (monoamine oxidase and catechol-O-methyltransferase \r\ninhibitors) [4]. 2.1.1.1 Direct-acting α-agonists\r\n2.1.1.1.1 Phenylephrine\r\nThe chemical formula of phenylephrine is C9H13NO2. It is an α-1 adrenergic agonist \r\nthat only affects β receptors at very high doses. As it is not a catechol derivative, it is \r\nnot broken down by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and has a longer duration \r\nof action than catecholamines. It can cause an increase in blood pressure by venous \r\nand arteriolar vasoconstriction, and since it does not act on β receptors, there is no \r\ndirect effect on cardiac muscle. The increase in blood pressure causes reflex bradycar-\r\ndia by stimulation of baroreceptors [5]. The intravenous (IV) phenylephrine hydrochloride increases blood pressure in \r\nadults with clinically significant hypotension resulting primarily from vasodilation \r\nin such settings as septic shock or anesthesia. Phenylephrine hydrochloride (HCL) \r\nis also used over-the-counter in ophthalmic formulations to promote mydriasis and \r\nconjunctival blood vessel vasoconstriction, intranasal administration as a treatment \r\nfor uncomplicated nasal congestion, and as an over-the-counter additive to topical \r\nhemorrhoid medications [5]. The ophthalmic formulations of phenylephrine act for 3–8 hours, while intrave-\r\nnous solutions have a practical half-life of 5 minutes and an elimination half-life of \r\n2.5 hours. The bioavailability orally is 38%, and ophthalmic solutions have clinically \r\nsignificant absorption, especially if the cornea is damaged. This drug is mainly \r\nmetabolized by monoamine oxidase A, monoamine oxidase B, and sulfotransferase \r\nfamily 1A member 3 (SULT1A3). The primary metabolite it forms is the inactive \r\nmeta-hydroxymandelic acid, followed by sulfate conjugates. It can also be metabo-\r\nlized to phenylephrine glucuronide. About 86% of the drug is recovered in urine; 16% \r\nof it is unmetabolized, and 57% of it is inactive meta-hydroxymendelic acid, and 8% \r\nis inactive sulfate conjugates [6]. The adverse effects of these drugs are nausea, vomiting, and confusion. Since \r\nphenylepinephrine increases the afterload more than the preload, the decreased \r\ncardiac output can also lead to severe bradycardia, exacerbating angina, heart failure, \r\nand pulmonary hypertension. Overdose can be treated by discontinuing the medica-\r\ntion, chronotropic medications, and vasodilators [5]. There are no absolute contraindications for using this drug apart from hypersen-\r\nsitivity reactions such as anaphylaxis or less severe asthmatic episodes. Currently, no \r\nantidote is available to reverse this drug’s effects. The treatment of hypertension and \r\nreflex bradycardia is discontinuing the administration of the drug [5].","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"30b325f8-0d17-4f4d-93a1-7c2686963f1f":{"id_":"30b325f8-0d17-4f4d-93a1-7c2686963f1f","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"q5iXy3I+uxnykZWdy938tLCu8HceZABIA6Lokext7Z4=","metadata":{},"hash":"SW0rtXZZNHYjgwm2KQcZaJe/KC98JlxTkRPNfVqK2xo="}},"hash":"wymp/+KB9+HRPlgwGpR8N2zaWKUwPFzA6c3rFDdZXuA=","text":"Topics in Autonomic Nervous System\r\n4\r\n2.1.1.1.2 Midodrine\r\nMidodrine is a prodrug (medication that turns into active form once it enters the \r\nbody). It is used to manage patients with orthostatic hypotension or hypotension \r\nsecondary to other clinical conditions or drug therapies [7]. The chemical formula of this drug is C12H19ClN2O4. It is water-soluble and dis-\r\ntributed as tablets for oral administration. Dosage forms are 2.5 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg. Midodrine is almost completely absorbed after oral administration and undergoes \r\nenzymatic hydrolysis to form its pharmacologically active metabolite, de-glymido-\r\ndrine. The drug should be stored in an airtight container [8]. The plasma levels of this prodrug peak at about half an hour and decline with \r\na half-life of approximately 25 minutes. The peak concentration of the metabo-\r\nlites reaches about 1–2 hours, and their half-life is about 3–4 hours. The absolute \r\nbioavailability is 93% and is not affected by food. Midodrine deglycination to \r\ndesglymidodrine appears in many tissues, and the liver metabolizes both com-\r\npounds [9]. It does not act on cardiac β-adrenergic receptors and poorly diffuses across the \r\nblood-brain barrier. Increased embryo reabsorption is revealed in animal studies, as \r\nwell as reduced fetal body weight and decreased fetal survival. There is no controlled \r\ndata on human pregnancy. It is labeled US FDA Pregnancy category C, but the poten-\r\ntial benefits may warrant the use in pregnant women, despite potential risks. No data \r\nis available for excretion in animal and human milk, but use should be avoided, and \r\ncaution is recommended [8]. The contraindications to the drug are allergy to the drug, kidney disease, or, if one \r\ncannot urinate, pheochromocytoma (adrenal gland tumor), overactive thyroid, high \r\nblood pressure even while lying down, and liver disease. Taking this drug alongside \r\nother drugs that constrict the blood vessels can increase blood pressure. Common \r\nadverse effects (1–10%) of the drug are supine hypertension, paresthesia, headache, \r\nnpiloerection, dysuria, nausea, dyspepsia, and vomiting [8]. The oral lethal dose (LD 50) is approximately 30–50 mg/kg in rats, 67.5 mg/kg in \r\nmice, and 125–160 mg/kg in dogs. Overdose symptoms could include hypertension, \r\npiloerection (goosebumps), a sensation of coldness, and urinary retention. The single \r\ndoses associated with overdosage or potentially life-threatening symptoms in humans \r\nare unknown. Desglymidodrine is dialyzable [9]. 2.1.1.2 Indirect-acting α-agonists\r\n2.1.1.2.1 Ephedrine\r\nEphedrine is an α- and β-adrenergic agonist; however, it also causes the indirect \r\nrelease of norepinephrine from sympathetic neurons, inhibiting norepinephrine \r\nreuptake and displacing more norepinephrine from storage vesicles. Its use is indi-\r\ncated in treating hypotension under anesthesia, allergic conditions, bronchial asthma, \r\nand nasal congestion. Its chemical formula is C10H15NO [10]. Ephedrine can be administered through oral, nasal, and intravenous routes (tab-\r\nlet/capsule:8–25 mg, Solution—0.5%, IV: 10–15 mg/1 mL). Ephedrine increases blood \r\npressure by stimulating heart rate and cardiac output and variably increasing periph-\r\neral resistance. Activation of β-adrenergic receptors in the lungs causes bronchodila-\r\ntion. By stimulating α-adrenergic receptors in bladder smooth muscle cells, ephedrine \r\nalso increases the resistance to the outflow of urine.

The bioavailability of ephedrine is 88%, and oral ephedrine reaches an average \r\nmaximum concentration (Cmax) of 79.5 ng/mL, with a time-to-peak concentration \r\n(Tmax) of 1.81 hours [10]. Ephedrine is largely unmetabolized in the body and can be N-demethylated to nor-\r\nephedrine or demethylated and deaminized to benzoic acid conjugates and 1,2-hydroxy-\r\npropyl benzene. The route of elimination is through the urine; about 60% is excreted as \r\nunmetabolized parent compound and 13% as benzoic acid conjugates and 1% as 1,2-dihy-\r\ndroxypropylbenzene. There is a large degree of inter-patient variability on the half-life of \r\nthis drug, but orally, the plasma elimination half-life is approximately 6 hours [10]. Its use is contraindicated in people with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, \r\nhyperthyroidism, pheochromocytoma, and closed-angle glaucoma [11]. Large doses \r\nof ephedrine cause nervousness, insomnia, vertigo, headache, tachycardia, palpita-\r\ntion, and sweating. Some patients have nausea, vomiting, and anorexia. Painful \r\nurination may occur as a result of a vesical sphincter spasm. Urinary retention may \r\ndevelop in males with prostatism. Cardiac arrhythmias and precordial pain may occur \r\nfollowing administration of ephedrine sulfate injection, USP [11]. The LD50 in mice after oral administration is 785 mg/kg, after intraperitoneal \r\nadministration is 248 mg/kg, and after subcutaneous administration is 425 mg/kg. An overdose of ephedrine will present with rapidly increasing blood pressure. The \r\noverdose can be managed with blood pressure monitoring and possibly administering \r\nparenteral antihypertensives [10]. 2.1.1.2.2 Methamphetamine\r\nIt is a sympathomimetic agent widely used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity  \r\ndisorder (ADHD) and exogenous obesity. Its chemical formula is C10H15N. Methamphetamine is a white solid odorless crystal. The recommended storage tem-\r\nperature is −20°C. This drug is a potent stimulant of the central nervous system, and \r\nit affects the neurochemical mechanisms responsible for regulating body tempera-\r\nture, heart rate, blood pressure, appetite, attention, mood, and responses associated \r\nwith alertness or alarm conditions. The drug’s acute effects closely resemble the \r\npsychological and physiological effects of an epinephrine-provoked flight-or-fight \r\nresponse; these responses include increased heart rate, vasoconstriction, increased \r\nblood pressure, hyperglycemia, and bronchodilation. It causes the elimination of \r\nfatigue, increased mental alertness, increased focus, and decreased appetite [12]. When methamphetamine enters the brain, it causes a cascade of norepinephrine, \r\ndopamine, and serotonin release. It acts as a dopaminergic and adrenergic reuptake \r\ninhibitor to a lesser extent, and in a higher concentration, it can act as a monoamine \r\noxidase inhibitor [12]. Absorption of methamphetamine occurs in the gastrointestinal tract, with peak \r\nconcentrations occurring at 3.13–6.3 hours after ingestion, and its effects may con-\r\ntinue up to 24 hours in larger doses. When the drug is administered by inhalation, or \r\nintranasally, a high degree of absorption occurs. The drug has a high lipophilicity; \r\nit is distributed across the blood-brain barrier and crosses the placenta. This drug \r\nshould be avoided in breastfeeding mothers as it is excreted through milk. The drug \r\nexcretion occurs through the urine and increases with the acidic pH metabolization of \r\nmethamphetamine occurs in the liver by aromatic hydroxylation, N-dealkylation, and \r\ndeamination; at least seven metabolites have been identified in urine [12, 13].","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"111ee5b2-d986-4ac1-95fc-0500dd6694e3":{"id_":"111ee5b2-d986-4ac1-95fc-0500dd6694e3","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"r40sXPz/kSDgxlqjNa6yS8ZXOXQXg5jlAY+uDHiXXzE=","metadata":{},"hash":"ZOmeh3qfwfQXtQhS9+LiuHE4cxC6j1YfXemO+0iXr6U="}},"hash":"aP4XiP2ERpU/hEVZNJP9t/7NDeKb/5s/VN2wa//jZfQ=","text":"Topics in Autonomic Nervous System\r\n6\r\nThe concurrent use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors with methamphetamine \r\nis contraindicated as a hypertensive crisis may occur. It is also contraindicated in \r\npatients with glaucoma, advanced arteriosclerosis, symptomatic cardiovascular \r\ndisease, moderate to severe hypertension, hyperthyroidism, known hypersensitivity, \r\nor idiosyncrasy to sympathomimetic amines. It is a Pregnancy category C drug. It is \r\nshown to have teratogenic and embryocidal effects in mammals given multiple high \r\nhuman doses. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women, \r\nbut it is recommended not to be used during pregnancy unless the potential benefit \r\njustifies the potential risk to the fetus [14]. Acute overdose of methamphetamine is manifested by restlessness, tremor, hyper-\r\nreflexia, rapid respiration, confusion, assaultiveness, hallucinations, panic states, \r\nhyperpyrexia, and rhabdomyolysis. Fatigue and depression usually follow the central \r\nstimulation. Cardiovascular effects include arrhythmias, hypertension or hypotension, \r\nand circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, \r\nand abdominal cramps. Fatal poisoning usually terminates in convulsions and coma [12]. Therapeutic methamphetamine blood concentration is 20–60 ug/dL; toxic meth-\r\namphetamine blood concentration is 60–500 ug/dL, and lethal methamphetamine \r\nblood concentration is 1–4 mg/dL [12]. Benzodiazepines represent first-line treat-\r\nment for methamphetamine toxicity but frequently require repeated and escalated \r\ndosing to achieve the effect [15].2.1.2 α-2 receptor agonists\r\nThe α-2 receptors constitute a family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) with \r\nthree pharmacological subtypes, α-2A, α-2B, and α-2C [16]. Most α-2A and α-2C sub-\r\ntypes are located mainly in the presynaptic central nervous system. When stimulated, \r\nthese receptor subtypes may be responsible for sedative, analgesic, and sympatholytic \r\neffects. On vascular smooth muscle, α-2B receptors are more prevalent and have been \r\nshown to mediate vasopressor effects. All three subtypes have been shown to inhibit \r\nadenylyl cyclase, resulting in decreased levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate and \r\nhyperpolarization of noradrenergic neurons in the medial dorsal pons, specifically in the \r\nlocus ceruleus [16]. As cyclic adenosine monophosphate is inhibited, potassium efflux \r\nvia calcium-activated channels prevents calcium ions from entering the nerve terminal, \r\ninhibiting neural discharge. This process inhibits the release of norepinephrine and \r\nreduces the activity of ascending noradrenergic pathways, resulting in hypnosis and \r\nsedation. Activation of this negative feedback loop may also result in decreased heart rate \r\nand blood pressure, as well as a diminished sympathetic stress response. Stimulation of α-2 receptors in the spinal column’s dorsal horn inhibits nociceptive neurons and reduces \r\nsubstance P release. Although there is evidence for supraspinal and peripheral sites of \r\naction, it is believed that the spinal mechanism accounts for the majority of the analgesic \r\neffects of α-2 agonist drugs [16]. Guanabenz, guanfacine, clonidine, tizanidine, medetomidine, and dexmedeto-\r\nmidine are all α-2 agonists with different potencies and affinities for different α-2 \r\nreceptor subtypes. Clonidine, tizanidine, and dexmedetomidine have seen the most \r\nclinical use and will be discussed in greater depth. 2.1.2.1 Clonidine\r\nClonidine, an imidazole molecule, is a selective partial agonist for α-2 adrenoceptors \r\nwith a 200:1 ratio (α2–α1).","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"1882b900-52c8-4f99-9229-fee69f659973":{"id_":"1882b900-52c8-4f99-9229-fee69f659973","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"KtCzBZC0ymyVsV5RyBq/aR3zQ6kFxy/jScXf4hhRzhU=","metadata":{},"hash":"nf4TkjfSIluFZ0Yimx1raR6djZYMRe8GPqcmCNPUPPA="}},"hash":"/xGyiuH7Q7JBZLdnJTNoSi41LZed4yXlBLXlG35Gc4Q=","text":"7\r\nPharmacology of the Autonomic Nervous System\r\nDOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.113006\r\nClonidine stimulates the brain stem’s α-adrenoreceptors. This action diminishes \r\ncentral nervous system sympathetic outflow and decreases peripheral resistance, \r\nrenal vascular resistance, heart rate, and blood pressure. Clonidine can be administered via various routes: oral, intravenous, transdermal, \r\nrectal, and different neuraxial routes. It is rapidly and nearly completely absorbed fol-\r\nlowing the oral route, reaching peak plasma levels in 60–90 minutes. A time-release \r\ntransdermal patch can also administer clonidine; however, therapeutic levels require \r\nat least 2 days. It has an elimination half-life of 8–12 hours, with 50% of the drug \r\nmetabolized in the liver to inactive metabolites and the rest being excreted unaltered \r\nin the kidney [17]. 2.1.2.2 Clinical uses\r\nClonidine and guanfacine may be used to treat children and adolescents with \r\nattention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The reduced firing of presynaptic neurons \r\nreleasing norepinephrine into the prefrontal cortex decreases the impulsive and \r\nhyperactive behavior seen in ADHD. Because of their additive effects on serotonin \r\nand γ-aminobutyric acid receptors, α-2 agonists are the most commonly utilized \r\ndrugs to treat lack of sleep in children with ADHD. Clonidine also treats chronic pain \r\ndisorders and withdrawal from opiates, benzodiazepines, alcohol, cocaine, food, and \r\ncigarette smoke [17]. Clonidine as an adjuvant has several advantages, including a reduction in the \r\namount of opioids necessary for analgesia and hence a likely reduction in opioid-\r\nrelated side effects, titrated sedation and anxiolysis with no additive respiratory \r\ndepression when combined with opioids and vasodilation and enhanced circulation \r\nof the cerebral, coronary, and visceral vascular beds [17]. Clonidine has lately been utilized as a premedication in individuals with consider-\r\nable pretreatment anxiety. It has been found to improve mask application during \r\nanesthesia induction and to reduce anesthetic requirements by 40–60% in the \r\npediatric population. 2.1.2.3 Dexmedetomidine\r\nDexmedetomidine, as clonidine, is a highly selective α-2 agonist with a higher \r\naffinity for the α-2 receptor (Figure 1). Clonidine has a specificity of 220: 1 (α-2: α-1), \r\nwhile dexmedetomidine has a specificity of 1620: 1. It is a full agonist of α-2 adrener-\r\ngic receptors and the pharmacologically active d-isomer of medetomidine [18]. Dexmedetomidine induces a state of unconsciousness equivalent to normal sleep \r\nby activating central pre- and postsynaptic α-2 receptors in the locus ceruleus, with \r\nthe added benefit of patients remaining easily stimulated and cooperative. Dexmedetomidine generates a dose-dependent biphasic blood pressure response. Low-dose intravenous infusion lowers mean arterial pressure due to selectivity for \r\ncentral and peripheral α-2 receptors. The subsequent decreases in heart rate and \r\nsystemic vascular resistance indirectly diminish cardiac output and systolic blood \r\npressure. These actions help modulate the stress response, improve stability, and \r\nguard against drastic changes in cardiovascular parameters after surgery [18]. Dexmedetomidine can be given orally, intravenously, intramuscularly, buccally, and \r\nintranasally. It has a two-compartment distribution and elimination model. It has a (T1/2 \r\nβ) of 2 hours for elimination. However, it is a highly lipophilic medication that rapidly \r\ndispersed and redistributed, with a (T1/2 α) of only 6 minutes for distribution.

Dexmedetomidine’s context-sensitive \r\nhalf-life ranges from 4 minutes after a 10-minute infusion to 250 minutes after an \r\n8-hour infusion [18]. 2.1.2.4 Clinical uses\r\nDexmedetomidine has three primary therapeutic applications: (a) in-hospital \r\nprolonged sedation, (b) procedure sedation and general anesthesia, and (c) obtund-\r\ning emerging delirium. It is utilized as a sedative drug in critical care settings for \r\ncritically ill patients who require prolonged sedation and mechanical ventilation. Dexmedetomidine possesses all of the features of an ideal critical care sedative. It \r\ndoes not cause respiratory depression, is analgesic and anxiolytic, has a fast onset, \r\nis titratable, and promotes drowsiness while maintaining hemodynamic stabil-\r\nity. Finally, dexmedetomidine is exceptionally effective in treating the emerging \r\ndelirium that can occur after general anesthesia, particularly in children. It has a \r\nsignificant relaxing effect without causing respiratory depression. This is a signifi-\r\ncant benefit over other medications typically used in such situations and requires \r\nadditional study.2.1.3 β-1 agonists\r\n2.1.3.1 Dobutamine\r\nDobutamine is a synthetic sympathomimetic drug that selectively stimulates \r\nβ-1 adrenergic receptors.

It increases the \r\ncontractility of the heart muscle (positive inotropic effect) and enhances cardiac \r\noutput. It also leads to mild vasodilation, primarily affecting the arterial system. In \r\nthe clinical settings, dobutamine primarily treats acute heart failure or cardiogenic \r\nshock. It is used to improve cardiac contractility and increase cardiac output in these \r\nconditions. 2.1.3.2 Dopamine\r\nDopamine is a neurotransmitter and a sympathomimetic drug that acts on dopamine \r\nreceptors in the central and peripheral nervous systems. It is crucial in physiological \r\nprocesses, including movement, motivation, reward, and blood pressure regulation. Dopamine is typically available as a solution for intravenous infusion. The healthcare \r\nprovider determines the concentration and dosage regimen based on the individual’s \r\nspecific needs. Pharmacokinetically, dopamine is administered intravenously due to its poor oral \r\nbioavailability. It has a rapid onset of action and a short duration of action. The drug \r\nis rapidly metabolized in the liver and excreted in the urine. Dopamine acts on different receptors, including dopamine receptors, α-1 adren-\r\nergic receptors, and β-adrenergic receptors. Its effects vary depending on the dose \r\nadministered. Dopamine primarily stimulates dopamine receptors at low doses, \r\nleading to renal and mesenteric vasodilation. It activates higher doses of α-1 and β-1 \r\nadrenergic receptors, increasing cardiac contractility and vasoconstriction. Dopamine treats various conditions, including hypotension, shock, and low \r\ncardiac output states. It helps increase blood pressure and cardiac output by improv-\r\ning cardiac contractility and causing peripheral vasoconstriction. 2.1.3.3 Epinephrine (adrenaline)\r\nEpinephrine, also known as adrenaline, is a naturally occurring catecholamine \r\nand a potent nonselective adrenergic agonist. It acts on α- and β-adrenergic receptors, \r\nproducing various physiological effects. Epinephrine is available in different formula-\r\ntions, including solutions for intravenous injection, autoinjectors, and inhalers. The \r\nconcentration and specific formulation may vary depending on the intended use. Epinephrine can be administered via various routes, including intravenous, \r\nintramuscular, subcutaneous, and inhalation. It has a rapid onset of action and a short \r\nduration of action. The drug is metabolized in the liver and other tissues, and the \r\nmetabolites are excreted in the urine. Epinephrine acts on both α- and β-adrenergic \r\nreceptors. It produces various effects, including increased heart rate and contractility, \r\nbronchodilation, peripheral vasoconstriction, and increased blood pressure. These \r\neffects are beneficial in emergencies such as anaphylaxis, cardiac arrest, and severe \r\nasthma exacerbations. Epinephrine is used in various emergencies, including anaphylaxis (severe allergic \r\nreactions), cardiac arrest, bronchospasm, and severe asthma exacerbations. It also \r\nrestores blood pressure and maintains organ perfusion during resuscitation efforts.2.1.4 β-2 agonists\r\nβ-adrenergic receptor agonists have long been used to treat both acute asthma \r\nsymptoms and the prevention of exercise-induced asthma in adults and children","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"3a8ccec9-3386-438f-a6a4-a086008024d0":{"id_":"3a8ccec9-3386-438f-a6a4-a086008024d0","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"VzWWUj9y1tJx7Cabigm0A/GI/xkY4a4Bn5LfBI+jVLw=","metadata":{},"hash":"80i8ej4eur8TPH9bmAtguzWXRsw4kbNihZfCsleoocM="}},"hash":"pwhKbL97R2GRm+mAOgV0Y4qwvLYiCmKFZ89L5itxxqs=","text":"Topics in Autonomic Nervous System\r\n10\r\nand to treat COPD. They mimic the actions of catecholamines such as epinephrine, \r\nnorepinephrine, and dopamine in triggering various autonomic responses within the \r\nbody. β-2 agonists significantly affect the smooth muscle of the airway, uterus, gut, \r\nand systemic vasculature. As part of our functional autonomic system, circulating catecholamines \r\nstimulate adrenergic receptors, resulting in parasympathetic and sympathetic \r\nphysiological reactions. β-2 agonists operate as ligands to adrenergic receptors \r\nwith higher selectivity for β-2 adrenergic receptors, mimicking catecholamines. When the β-2 adrenergic receptor is activated, a transmembrane signal cascade is \r\ninitiated that includes the heterotrimeric G protein, Gs, and the effector, adenylyl \r\ncyclase. Adenylyl cyclase then raises intracellular cAMP through ATP hydrolysis. The increased cAMP concentration activates the cAMP-dependent protein kinase \r\nA (PKA). PKA can phosphorylate intracellular substrates, which modulate vari-\r\nous actions within the cell. PKA, in particular, operates in airway smooth muscle \r\nto phosphorylate Gq-coupled receptors, resulting in a cascade of intracellular \r\nsignals that have been postulated to diminish intracellular Ca2+ or decrease Ca2+ \r\nsensitivity [19]. The increase in Ca2+ inhibits myosin light chain phosphorylation, which prevents \r\nairway smooth muscle contraction. This is the underlying mechanism of β-2 ago-\r\nnists, which boost bronchodilatory effects and are used to treat a variety of common \r\nrespiratory disorders. There have been suggestions that β-2 agonists have anti-\r\ninflammatory effects within the airway smooth muscle by decreasing intercellular \r\nadhesion molecule-1, decreasing granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor \r\nrelease, and stabilizing mast cell degranulation by inhibiting multiple inflamma-\r\ntory pathways.T16 The duration and start of the action of β-2 agonists influence their \r\nclassification. The three categories are short-acting, long-acting, and, most recently, \r\nultra-long-acting β-agonists. 2.1.4.1 Short-acting β-2 agonists\r\nThey are first-line drugs for treating acute asthma symptoms and exacerbations. They are also often used in treating COPD in conjunction with long-acting, inhaled \r\ncorticosteroids or long-acting muscarinic agonists. These drugs are often adminis-\r\ntered through inhalation, either metered dosage, dry powder inhalation, or nebu-\r\nlization. Compared to alternative oral delivery, inhalation has a higher therapeutic \r\nbenefit and fewer systemic side effects. This family includes Salbutamol (albuterol), \r\nTerbutaline, Levalbuterol, and Pirbuterol. 2.1.4.2 Salbutamol\r\nSalbutamol absorption is highly dependent on both formulation and dosage as \r\nwell as the way of delivery. A thorough description of the effect of delivery systems \r\non salbutamol pharmacokinetics may occupy many book chapters and is beyond the \r\nscope of this piece; however, we will consider some of the key points. Salbutamol is \r\nusually administered via a compressed metered-dose inhaler with an immense buffer. This very efficient delivery mechanism assures good distribution, especially to small- \r\nto moderate-sized airways. It can, however, be inhaled using a dry powder inhaler, or \r\nnebulizer, orally or intravenously. Salbutamol, a partial agonist, has the greatest bronchodilating action at low \r\ndosages.

This binding causes a postsynaptic action on adenyl cyclase, \r\nresulting in the formation of intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) from ATP, which in \r\nturn stimulates other effector molecules, including cAMP-dependent protein kinase \r\nA (PKA) and nucleotide exchange factor, which work together to cause intracellular \r\nCa2+ sequestration, resulting in ASM relaxation. Despite that salbutamol’s primary \r\nfunction is bronchodilation, it also suppresses mast cell mediator release and tumor \r\nnecrosis factor α (TNF) release from monocytes. It also enhances mucus production \r\nand clearance of the mucociliary tract. It has extensive effects across numerous organ \r\nsystems as a sympathomimetic, and it causes dose-dependent tachycardia, hypergly-\r\ncemia, hypokalemia, and tremor. The systemic metabolic effects inducing glycogen \r\nbreakdown and concomitant insulin release (possibly stimulated by pancreatic β2 \r\ncells) combine to cause high blood sugar levels and serum hypokalemia, with the \r\nformer occurring as a consequence of cellular sodium excretion and potassium influx \r\n(Na-K-ATPase pump). This side effect is beneficial in the emergency treatment of hyperkalemia, where \r\nongoing salbutamol administration can decrease serum potassium between 1 and \r\n1.5 mmol/L. However, it can also have complications such as dose-related tremors \r\n(the salbutamol shakes’), and when combined with cardiac receptor stimulation, \r\nstimulation can lead to tachyarrhythmias. Tachyphylaxis to β-2 agonists arises as soon \r\nas 1 week after starting regular medication and is more apparent with β 2-agonist \r\nmonotherapy. 2.1.4.3 Terbutaline\r\nIt is also a selective β-2 adrenoceptor agonist used to prevent and reverse \r\n bronchoconstriction. Approximately, its volume of distribution is about 1.6 L/kg. After \r\n72 hours, an oral dose of terbutaline gets eliminated in the urine by 40%. Terbutaline \r\nsulfate conjugated was the most predominant metabolite in the urine. Terbutaline par-\r\nenteral levels are 90% removed in the urine, with roughly 2/3 as the unaltered primary \r\nsubstance. In the feces, less than 1% of a terbutaline dose gets eliminated. 2.1.4.4 Long-acting β-2 agonist\r\nThey are commonly used in managing asthma and COPD patients, often \r\n combined with inhaled corticosteroids. There is evidence that combination therapy \r\nis more effective than monotherapy. They have a longer onset time than short-acting \r\nmedications, with salmeterol having an onset period of up to 15 minutes and lasting \r\nat least 12 hours. The suggested route of administration is inhalation, as with short \r\nacting. They are typically used as a second-line treatment in asthma patients who have \r\nfailed to get clinical relief with short-acting medications. Salmeterol and formoterol \r\nare the commonest drugs in this group. 2.1.4.5 Salmeterol\r\nIn asthmatic patients, a 50 μg dose of inhaled salmeterol powder reaches a Cmax of \r\n47.897 pg./mL, with a Tmax of 0.240 h and an AUC of 156.041 pg./mL/h. The distribu-\r\ntion volume of the main compartment is 177 L, and the distribution volume of the \r\nperipheral one is 3160 L. Salmeterol is 96% protein linked to albumin and α-1-acid \r\nglycoprotein in plasma. It is primarily processed by CYP3A4 to α-hydroxysalmeterol1, \r\nwith little contribution from an unknown process to an O-dealkylated metabolite.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"d712ab51-bc86-4cdb-b418-71ac51274d01":{"id_":"d712ab51-bc86-4cdb-b418-71ac51274d01","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"MPruBuwmsszYVZoiqFWYY5bSHZebe8nvZdZl2vcElEo=","metadata":{},"hash":"tsktyLGiGlOCln9Q6fYAp0g0C7jsvQ0Dm/L5/3lOY/c="}},"hash":"EP3AXAjGcr+Ei13u0A52Y5YIa90SgDsNKCVpYo76PCQ=","text":"Topics in Autonomic Nervous System\r\n12\r\nSalmeterol is removed in the feces at 57.4% and the urine at 23%.

In asthmatic patients, long-acting β-agonists such as formoterol \r\nwithout accompanying inhaled corticosteroids should be avoided, as long-acting \r\n monotherapy has been linked to an increased risk of asthma-related fatalities.

Indacaterol can be taken as a dry powder with a \r\n5-minute onset of action. Many different ultra-LABAs are now being researched, with \r\nthe potential to increase compliance and efficiency over current asthma and COPD \r\ntherapy choices. Indacaterol, Vilanterol, and Oladaerol are the drugs in this group. 2.1.4.8 Administration\r\nMetered-dose inhalers, nebulizers, dry powder inhalers, orally, subcutaneously, \r\nor intravenously are the most common delivery methods for β-2 agonists. Inhalation \r\nis the primary mode of delivery for β-2 agonists in treating asthma and COPD. Inhalation concentrates the therapeutic impact of the medicine on the airway’s \r\nsmooth muscles while minimizing the drug’s diffusion to the systemic circulation. There is no association between the therapeutic impact of inhaled β-2 agonists and \r\ntheir peak plasma levels. Oral β-2 agonists, which have been demonstrated to exacer-\r\nbate systemic side effects, are used less commonly.

According to several publications ranging from single case reports to case-control \r\nstudies, cardiac toxicity in the form of arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, and ischemia \r\nhas been more strongly associated with earlier-generation β-2 agonists. β-2 agonists \r\nhave been demonstrated to lower serum potassium levels by causing an inward influx \r\nof potassium into cells via an action on the membrane-bound Na/K-ATPase, which \r\ncan lead to hypokalemia. β-2 agonists also accelerate glycogenolysis, which might \r\nresult in unintentional increases in serum glucose. Musculoskeletal tremors are \r\nanother possible side effect, which is more familiar with using oral β-2 agonists. The \r\nseverity of these side effects is often related to factors such as the affinity of each β-2 \r\nagonist to its specific receptor and medication dosages. Several studies additionally \r\ndiscovered hypoxemia and hypercapnia to be aggravating variables for β-2 agonist \r\ncardiotoxicity.T25\r\n2.2 Sympatholytics2.2.1 α-blockers\r\nSympatholytic drugs inhibit the effects of catecholamines by acting on postsynaptic \r\nadrenergic receptors present in target organs or by inhibiting the synthesis and stor-\r\nage of the catecholamines. These drugs can be divided into two subtypes, selective \r\nand nonselective α-receptor blockers. Nonselective α-receptor antagonists block both the α-1 receptors as well as α-2 \r\nreceptors. Blocking α-1 receptor causes vasodilation, while α-2 receptor blockade will \r\nreduce the force of vasodilation due to increased release of Norepinephrine. These \r\nmedications, such as pheochromocytoma, are widely used in patients with increased \r\nsympathetic activity. Selective α-1 receptor blockers act on the receptors and cause vasodilation; therefore, \r\nthey are widely used in patients with hypertension and cause smooth muscle relax-\r\nation, so they help manage benign prostate hyperplasia [20]. The mechanism of action of α-2 receptor blockers is not known, although, in \r\nprinciple, they are known to inhibit negative feedback of norepinephrine release by \r\nstimulating the norepinephrine system, and they inhibit the effects of norepinephrine \r\non postsynaptic α-2 adrenoceptors [20, 21]. 2.2.1.1 Nonselective α-receptor blockers\r\n2.2.1.1.1 Phentolamine\r\nIt is a nonselective α-receptor blocker used mainly to diagnose pheochromocytoma \r\nand to control or prevent paroxysmal hypertension immediately before or during \r\npheochromocytoma ectomy.

Other members of this drug class include \r\nDoxazosin, Terazosin, Tamsulosin, and Alfuzosin. This effect likely occurs through \r\nthe inhibition of adrenergic stimulation found in states of hyperarousal. As this agent \r\ndoes not negatively impact lung function, it can manage hypertension in chronic \r\nobstructive lung diseases [23]. The chemical formula of the drug is C19H21N5O4.

Prazosin is metabolized \r\nin the liver by demethylation and conjugation and is excreted mainly in the bile and \r\nfeces. The clearance of the drug is decreased in people with congestive heart failure. As the drug lowers blood pressure, it can cause a clinically significant decrease in \r\ncardiac output, heart rate, blood flow to the kidney, and glomerular filtration rate. The decrease in blood pressure may occur in both standing and supine positions [23]. Shock caused by low blood pressure should first be treated with volume expanders, \r\nand vasopressors should be used if deemed necessary. Renal function should be \r\nmonitored and supported as needed [25]. The LD50 in humans is 285 μg/kg orally. Severe drowsiness and decreased reflex \r\noccurred with ingesting at least 50 mg of Prazosin. There was no fall in blood pressure, \r\nand the child recovered without complications.

Specific cases of emergent use for blood pressure control during pregnancy \r\nshowed no effects on the fetus or neonate. As the drug is excreted in small amounts in \r\nbreast milk, it should be used cautiously in breastfeeding mothers. Avoid alcohol and licorice with the use of this drug. Its absorption is not affected \r\nby food. Acute symptomatic liver injury due to prazosin is rare, and severe hepatotox-\r\nicity must be rare if it occurs at all [26]. 2.2.1.2.2 Tamsulosin\r\nIt is an α-1A and α-1B adrenergic receptor antagonist used to treat benign prostatic \r\nhyperplasia, ureteral stones, female voiding problems, and prostatitis. The chemical \r\nformula is C20H28N2O5S(R38). It is available in the form of tablets, and the dose for \r\ntreatment of adult benign prostate hyperplasia is 0.4 mg orally once a day; the dose \r\nmay be increased to 0.8 mg orally once a day in patients who fail to respond to 0.4 mg \r\nonce a day within 2–4 weeks [27]. The most significant effect of this drug is in the bladder and prostate, where \r\nthe α-1A and α-1B adrenergic receptors are most common. The drug’s action leads \r\nto the relaxation of prostate and bladder muscles, allowing for better urinary flow. Tamsulosin binds to α-1A receptors 3.9–38 times more selectively than α-1B and 3–20 \r\ntimes more selectively than α-1D. A significant effect on urinary flow with a reduced \r\nincidence of adverse reactions like orthostatic hypotension is allowed through this \r\nselectivity [28]. Tamsulosin is absorbed 90% in patients who are fasting. Taking the drug with \r\nfood increases the time to maximum concentration from 4 to 5 hours to 6–7 hours \r\nbut increases bioavailability by 30% and maximum plasma concentration by \r\n40–70% [28]. The drug is metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and 2D6 in the liver, with \r\nsome metabolism by other CYPs. There is a low rise in liver transaminases by tamsu-\r\nlosin, but clinically, apparent liver injury is rare [28]. The oral LD50 in rats is 650 mg/kg. In an overdose, the patients might have hypo-\r\ntension that should be managed supportively by lying supine, administering fluids, \r\nor if further progression occurs, vasopressors might be needed, and renal function \r\nshould be closely monitored. As tamsulosin is highly protein-bound, dialysis does not \r\nassist in treating overdose [28].

At levels above the recommended dose, tamsulosin may be carcinogenic. There is a slight increase in mammary gland fibroadenomas and adenocarcinoma \r\nrates in female rats [28].2.2.2 β-blockers\r\nβ-blockers block the physiological impacts of sympathetic nerve stimulation or \r\ncirculating catecholamines on β-adrenoceptors, which exist across different organs \r\nin the body. Many organs have both β1 and β2 receptors coexisting (Table 1). For \r\nexample, approximately 80% of the receptors are of the β-1 subtype in a typical \r\nindividual heart. In heart failure, β1 receptors are downregulated, allowing a greater \r\nnumber of β2 receptors to be detected. The physiological and therapeutic effects \r\nof a β-blocker are determined by the actual quantity of β-1 or β-2 receptors in the \r\nvarious organs, the β-blocker’s affinity, and the local drug concentration. When the \r\nbioavailability of β-blockers with a strong affinity for β-adrenoceptors is not too low, \r\nthey can be helpful in small doses. Their effect persists even if they are washed out of \r\nthe extracellular area. As a result, the plasma half-life of the β-phase of elimination \r\ncannot forecast their duration of activity. This is particularly true for many medicines \r\nthat have a high affinity and a short plasma half-life (2–4 h for the β-phase).T26\r\nMany β-blockers have additional features that may influence their value in \r\nindividuals:\r\n1.

Partial agonist activity (intrinsic sympathomimetic activity): When baseline adren-\r\nergic firing is low (as during sleep), this manifests as a β-stimulant effect, but \r\nwhen adrenergic action is high (as during exercise), this manifests as β-blockade. Pindolol is a β-blocker with partial agonist action. 3. Membrane-stabilizing activity: Sotalol confers a local anesthetic and anti-arrhyth-\r\nmic effect. 4. Additional characteristics: Some β-blockers, such as carvedilol and labetalol, oppose \r\neffects conveyed at peripheral α-adrenoceptors, activate β2-adrenoceptors (e.g., \r\nceliprolol), or exhibit direct vasodilation effect (e.g., nebivolol). The extent to which β-blockers are eliminated by the kidney or the liver varies, \r\nusually with considerable first-pass metabolism. Lipid-soluble β-blockers, such as \r\nlabetalol, metoprolol, pindolol, and propranolol, are typically eliminated via the liver, \r\nwhereas water-soluble β-blockers, such as atenolol, get eliminated by the kidney.

Hypoglycemia can be overlooked in insulin-dependent diabetes due to a reduc-\r\ntion in sympathetic nerve stimulation. 3. Pharmacology of the parasympathetic nervous system (PANS)\r\nThe PANS, often called the “rest and digest” system, conserves energy and \r\npromotes homeostasis during periods of relaxation. Acetylcholine is the primary \r\nneurotransmitter in PANS signaling, acting on cholinergic receptors in various tis-\r\nsues. Cholinergic receptors are divided into two major types: nicotinic and muscarinic \r\ncholinergic receptors [1]. Nicotinic receptors are found at the neuromuscular junction and in the SANS and \r\nPANS ganglia. Activation of these receptors leads to subsequent muscle contraction or \r\nneurotransmitter release [1]. Nicotinic agonists, such as nicotine, are used primarily in \r\nsmoking cessation therapies due to their stimulatory effects on the central nervous sys-\r\ntem [3]. In contrast, neuromuscular blocking agents, which act as nicotinic antagonists, \r\nare utilized in anesthesia to induce muscle relaxation during surgical procedures. Muscarinic receptors: Muscarinic receptors are further classified into five sub-\r\ntypes, M1–M5. The PANS innervates these receptors in various target tissues, includ-\r\ning the heart, smooth muscles, exocrine glands, and CNS structures. M1 receptors \r\nare predominantly located in the CNS, where their activation modulates cognitive \r\nfunction and memory. M2 receptors are primarily found in the heart, where activa-\r\ntion slows heart rate and reduces contractility. M3 receptors are abundant in smooth \r\nmuscles, glands, and endothelial cells. Stimulation of M3 receptors leads to broncho-\r\nconstriction, increased glandular secretions, and vasodilation. The clinical utility of muscarinic agonists is limited compared to their antagonists. However, muscarinic antagonists, also known as anticholinergic drugs, play a crucial \r\nrole in anesthesia. These agents, such as atropine and glycopyrrolate, counteract \r\nexcessive PANS activity during anesthesia induction; prevent unwanted bradycardia, \r\nreduce salivary, and bronchial secretions; and facilitate intubation [1]. 3.1 Parasympathomimetics\r\n3.1.1 Muscarinic receptor agonist\r\n3.1.1.1 Pilocarpine\r\nPilocarpine is a parasympathomimetic drug classified as a muscarinic receptor \r\nagonist.

Pilocarpine \r\nis available in various formulations, including eye drops, tablets, and solutions. Eye drops are commonly used for ophthalmic purposes. Concentrations may vary \r\ndepending on the specific indication. Storage conditions may involve protecting the \r\ndrug from light and excessive heat. Pilocarpine can be administered topically to the eye or orally. When applied \r\ntopically to the eye, it has poor systemic absorption. Oral pilocarpine is well-absorbed \r\nfrom the gastrointestinal tract. The drug undergoes hepatic metabolism, primarily via \r\nhydrolysis, and is excreted mainly in the urine. Pilocarpine selectively activates muscarinic receptors, predominantly the M3 \r\nsubtype. It stimulates cholinergic receptors in various tissues, leading to miosis \r\n(pupillary constriction), increased salivation, sweating, bronchoconstriction, and \r\ngastrointestinal motility. Clinically, pilocarpine eye drops are commonly used to treat glaucoma, where they \r\nreduce intraocular pressure by increasing the drainage of aqueous humor from the \r\neye. Pilocarpine can also manage dry mouth (xerostomia) associated with Sjögren’s \r\nsyndrome or radiation therapy. Pilocarpine is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity to \r\nthe drug, uncontrolled asthma, acute iritis, or narrow-angle glaucoma. It should be \r\nused cautiously in patients with cardiovascular diseases or gastrointestinal disor-\r\nders. Other common side effects of pilocarpine may include localized ocular effects \r\nlike temporary blurred vision, eye discomfort, or burning sensation when used \r\nas eye drops. Systemic effects can include increased sweating, increased saliva-\r\ntion, gastrointestinal disturbances (such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea), and \r\nbronchoconstriction. In cases of overdose or excessive use, pilocarpine can lead to excessive cholinergic \r\nstimulation. Symptoms may include profuse sweating, salivation, miosis, gastrointes-\r\ntinal distress, and potentially life-threatening cardiovascular effects. Treatment may \r\ninvolve discontinuing the drug, supportive measures, and administering atropine as a \r\ncompetitive antagonist to counteract the excessive muscarinic effects. 3.1.2 Acetyl-cholinesterase inhibitors\r\n3.1.2.1 Neostigmine\r\nNeostigmine is a reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, classified as a \r\n parasympathomimetic drug.

It increases the concentration of acetylcholine at cho-\r\nlinergic synapses by inhibiting the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, which breaks down \r\nacetylcholine. Rivastigmine is available in oral capsules, oral solutions, and trans-\r\ndermal patches. The capsules and oral solution come in various strengths, typically \r\n1.5–6 mg, while the transdermal patches are available in different doses. Rivastigmine can be administered orally or transdermally. When given orally, it \r\nis well-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. It undergoes extensive metabolism \r\nin the liver, and the elimination half-life varies depending on the individual’s genetic \r\nmakeup. Rivastigmine inhibits acetylcholinesterase, increasing acetylcholine concen-\r\ntration and enhancing cholinergic neurotransmission. It primarily acts in the central \r\nnervous system, specifically targeting acetylcholinesterase in the brain.

They work by blocking the muscarinic receptors \r\nof the parasympathetic system. Most drugs with parasympatholytic properties are \r\nanticholinergics [29]. Parasympatholytic’s pharmacodynamic effects include reduction of glandular \r\nsecretion, dilatation of the pupil, paralysis of accommodation, increase of intraocular \r\npressure, reduction of lacrimation, and more. These effects render parasympatholyt-\r\nics therapeutically valuable for treating slow heart rhythms, bronchioles constriction, \r\nand conditions such as benign prostatic hyperplasia, urinary retention, intestinal \r\natony, and tachycardia [29]. It is worth mentioning, however, that parasympatholytics \r\ncan interact with multiple drugs that can potentiate the antimuscarinic effect, such as \r\nantihistamines, neuroleptics, antidepressants, quinidine, or antiparkinson drugs [30]. Examples of parasympatholytics include atropine, methscopolamine bromide, \r\nflavoxate, orphenadrine, tiotropium, pinaverium, butylscopolamine, and anisoda-\r\nmine. However, atropine is the most used in the clinical setting. 3.2.1 Atropine\r\nAtropine is classified as an anticholinergic or a parasympatholytic drug. Clinically, \r\natropine is mainly indicated to treat bradyarrhythmias. Atropine also augments \r\ncardiac contractility by inhibiting cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase type 4, acting as \r\na positive inotropic agent. Atropine is a tropane alkaloid obtained from the deadly nightshade (Atropa bella-\r\ndonna) and other plants of the family Solanaceae. Its chemical formula is C17H23NO3, \r\nhas a molecular weight of 289.4 g/mol (Figure 2), and is a racemic mixture of equi-\r\nmolar concentrations of (S)- and (R)-atropine. Atropine contains several functional \r\ngroups, including an ester group, a hydroxyl group, and a tertiary amine group. The \r\nstructure of atropine can be diagrammatically represented as benzene acetic acid, α-(hydroxymethyl)-8-methyl-azabicyclo {3.2. 1} oct-3-yl ester endo-(±). On hydroly-\r\nsis, atropine gives (±)-tropic acid and tropine. Atropine is an antimuscarinic agent that acts as a reversible, nonspecific antago-\r\nnist of muscarinic receptors. It exerts its action by inhibiting the muscarinic actions \r\nof acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves and \r\nsmooth muscles, which respond to endogenous acetylcholine but are not so inner-\r\nvated. Atropine leads to both increased respiratory rate and depth, possibly due to \r\nthe drug-induced inhibition of the vagus nerve. Generally, atropine counteracts \r\nthe “rest and digest” activity of glands regulated by the parasympathetic nervous \r\nsystem. Common medical uses of atropine include its role as an antisialagogue during sur-\r\ngery and anesthesia. It is also available in eye drops to treat uveitis and early amblyo-\r\npia. Outside medicine, atropine is also used in the agricultural domain as a pesticide. The pharmacological effects of atropine are due to binding to muscarinic ace-\r\ntylcholine receptors. Atropine is a competitive, reversible antagonist at muscarinic \r\nreceptors, which blocks the effects of acetylcholine and other choline esters.

Atropine can cause several side effects, mild or severe, depending on the dose and \r\nthe individual’s response to the drug. Some of the most common side effects of atro-\r\npine include dry mouth, blurred vision, dry eyes, photophobia, confusion, headache, \r\ndizziness, fatigue, tachycardia, palpitations, flushing, urinary hesitance or retention, \r\nconstipation, nausea, vomiting, and so on. 4. Conclusion\r\nIn conclusion, exploring autonomic nervous system (ANS) pharmacology \r\npresented in this chapter provides a comprehensive understanding of the intricate \r\ninterplay between neurotransmitters, receptors, and drugs within the sympathetic \r\nand parasympathetic divisions. This chapter unveils the complexity of ANS modula-\r\ntion by dissecting the mechanisms of both agonists and antagonists and delving into \r\ndirect and indirect drug actions. The broad spectrum of examples discussed underscores the significance of ANS \r\npharmacology across various medical disciplines. From managing hypotension and \r\nother medical problems, the clinical applications are far-reaching. The meticulous analy-\r\nsis of pharmacokinetics, metabolism, adverse effects, and contraindications empowers \r\nhealthcare professionals to make informed decisions that optimize patient care. For anesthesiologists, in particular, this knowledge is indispensable. The ability to \r\nfinely tune autonomic responses during procedures can significantly impact patient \r\noutcomes and safety. A robust understanding of ANS pharmacology is a cornerstone \r\nof any physician toolkit, enabling them to navigate the intricate balance of autonomic \r\ncontrol in the perioperative setting.
